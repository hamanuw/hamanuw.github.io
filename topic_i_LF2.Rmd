Figure 3 - Benign intraductal air

a) Magnified sagittal T2-weighted fat suppressed MRI image of the right breast shows linear branching signal voids within subareolar ducts representing air
b) Magnified CC mammographic image of the right breast shows corresponding linear branching lucencies.

**Teaching points**:

Signal void secondary to air can be seen on MRI images both on T1 and T2 weighted images. The etiology in healthy patients is unclear.   However, it’s a common iatrogenic cause, such as post MRI guided biopsy and ductography.

Figure 2 - Sagittal T2-weighted fat suppressed image of the left breast shows a benign T2 hyperintense 3 cm cyst in the central breast.  Ghosting artifact is seen superior and inferior to the cyst as well as superior and inferior to the separate T2 hyperintense nipple marker.  (arrows).  

**Teaching points**:

Phase-encoded motion artifact is commonly seen in breast imaging due to physical movement of the patient and manifests as ghosting in the direction of phase encoding, which is usually in the direction of short axis of the image as illustrated in this case. The spacing between these artifacts is related to the TR and frequency of the motion. Unlike  Gibbs or truncation artifacts, the motion artifacts usually extend across the entire FOV as illustrated in this case.  Possible solutions to phase-encoded motion artifact include cardiac / respiratory gating, switching phase and frequency directions, increasing the number of signal averages and shortening the scan time when motion is from patient moving.

Figure 1:

a) Sagittal post-contrast subtraction and 
b) corresponding CAD color overlay images show  1.2 cm of linear non-mass enhancement in the retroareolar left breast with a persistent delayed enhancement pattern color coded as blue.  The finding was considered indeterminate and second look ultrasound and consideration of MRI guided biopsy was recommended.

Figure 2:

a) Outside MRI images of the same region performed 12 months prior demonstrate a round, rim-enhancing mass in the retro-areolar left breast
b) the T1-weighted non-fat suppressed image, central macroscopic fat is evident, consistent with benign fat necrosis.  Final assessment was BIRADS 2. 

**Teaching points**:

Fat necrosis is a process involving a cascade of cellular events starting with tissue injury.   Fat cells undergo liquefaction necrosis, increased vascularization and infiltration of fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. Subsequently, there is proliferation of foreign body giant cells with fibrosis. The focus of fat necrosis may be replaced with a scar or persist as an oil cyst walled off by fibrous tissue.  Fat necrosis of the breast is commonly seen secondary to breast procedures and surgery.  Clinically, fat necrosis may be palpable at the site of injury.   Mammographically, oils cysts can be seen as well as peripherally located calcifications creating the appearance of lucent "bubbles".  Calcifications typically coarsen as fat necrosis evolves.  However, the appearance early fat necrosis and malignancy can overlap with an ill-defined and spiculated mass-like area and calcifications that mimic DCIS. Sonographically, the appearance of fat necrosis is variable from a well-defined hypoechoic mass likely representing an oil cyst to an irregular hypoechoic mass. It’s important to evaluate the sonographic images in the context of mammographic findings. On breast MRI, typical appearance of fat necrosis is peripheral enhancement surrounding central fat, best delineated on T1 non-fat saturated images as illustrated in this case.  However, the evolving fat necrosis can have a variable appearance and comparison to prior imaging studies as well as surgical history is important.  When imaging features are indeterminate and clinical history is unclear, core biopsy is appropriate.  Fat necrosis can be a benign concordant finding for most indeterminate MRI lesions and usually do not require surgical excision.

## b9 necrosis 2 - Palpable right axillary lump in a patient with prior bilateral mastectomies and TRAM flap reconstructions
(a)<img src="images/LF2/b9_necrosis2/a1a.tif" style="width:40%">
(b)<img src="images/LF2/b9_necrosis2/a1b.tif" style="width:40%">

Figure 1:

a) Axial T1-weighted fat suppressed post-contrast image shows contiguous linear heart-shaped enhancement (arrowheads) in the posterior lower outer breast with a persistent delayed enhancement pattern color coded as blue. This area likely corresponds to the palpable concern.  Enhancement of the TRAM (transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous) flap’s vascular pedicle is incidentally noted in the medial posterior reconstructed breast
b) Corresponding axial T1-weighted non-fat saturated image shows central focal fat within the heart-shaped rim of enhancement, consistent with benign fat necrosis.  

**Teaching points**:

Large areas of fat necrosis can present clinically as a palpable concern.  Peripherally enhancing lesion with central macroscopic fat is consistent with a benign fat necrosis.  When these typical features are present, biopsy or short term follow-up is not warranted.  Area of fat necrosis is a common finding in patients with extensive surgery such as breast reduction or mastectomies with reconstruction as illustrated in this case.

Figure 1:

a) Sagittal T1-weighted fat suppressed post-contrast image shows a 1.5 cm area of irregular non-mass enhancement in the posterior lower outer left breast, which partially demonstrates a suspicious washout enhancement pattern (arrow)
b) Sagittal T1-weighted non-fat suppressed image shows adjacent focal fat suggestive of fat necrosis. 

<img src="images/LF2/b9_necrosis3/a2.tif" style="width:40%">

Figure 2: Mammographic ML magnification view shows coarse heterogeneous calcifications correlating with the area of enhancement on MRI.

**Teaching points**:

Due to the asymmetric enhancement involving only the anterior aspect of the focal fat and suspicious mammographic findings, biopsy was recommended.  Patient declined the biopsy and on subsequent breast MRIs, there was gradual decrease in enhancement supporting a benign etiology.   Not all patients with fat necrosis have clinical history of trauma and all the typical imaging appearance.  However, when uncertain, core biopsy can be an appropriate management.

Figure 1:

a) Sagittal T1-weighted fat suppressed post-contrast image shows intense non-mass enhancement involving the visualized parenchyma with several non-enhancing scattered T1 dark foci (arrows) in the mid to posterior right breast
b) Corresponding sagittal T2-weighted fat suppressed image shows these foci (arrows) to demonstrate marked T2 hypointensity.  These dark foci persisted on non-fat saturated images and subsequent mammogram was performed which showed no visible calcifications (not shown).  

**Teaching points**: 

Fat necrosis has a variable appearance on MRI and clinical history is important.  The T1 dark and T2 dark foci in this case likely represent blood product containing hemosiderin.  Calcifications can also have a similar appearance on MRI but were not present on mammogram.  The patient was managed conservatively with a short-term follow-up MRI which showed a decrease in non-mass enhancement likely indicating background parenchymal enhancement with persistent dark foci.

Figure 1:

a) Axial T1-weighted  image shows a large 9.5 cm circumscribed oval hypointense mass occupying most of the left breast.  There are areas of linear lower signal intensity (arrows) within the mass likely representing septations.  A smaller 2.2 cm right breast mass with similar signal characteristics is noted
b) These masses show corresponding T2 hyperintensity with areas of linear higher signal intensity (arrows) within the masses likely representing septations
c) Axial post-contrast subtraction image shows intense homogeneous enhancement of both masses with central linear areas of non-enhancement corresponding to the T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense septations.  

<img src="images/LF2/b9_juvenile_fa/a2.tif" style="width:40%">

Figure 2 -  More superior axial T1-weighted fat suppressed post-contrast image with CAD kinetics analysis shows a third mass (4.3 cm, arrow) in the right breast.  Both masses demonstrate a predominantly persistent delayed enhancement pattern color coded as blue.  

**Teaching points**: 

The patient underwent surgical excision of these 3 masses yielding juvenile fibroadenomas.  MRI features in this case are typical for a fibroepithelial lesion showing circumscribed masses with T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity and  non-enhancing septations. Juvenile or cellular fibroadenoma is an uncommon histologic variant of fibroadenoma that frequently undergoes markedly rapid growth. A fibroadenoma over 5–10 cm in diameter is termed a giant fibroadenoma. Approximately 10%–25% of patients with juvenile fibroadenomas have multiple or bilateral tumors at presentation .

Figure 2:

a) Targeted ultrasound of the left breast reveals a corresponding 3.5 cm mixed echogenic mass with indistinct borders (arrows)
b) The mass underwent ultrasound guided core biopsy yielding PASH.  Post biopsy mammogram shows a large low density mass in the upper outer left breast with a centrally placed biopsy clip (arrow) corresponding to the sonographic and MRI masses. 

**Teaching points**:

Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a benign form of stromal (mesenchymal) overgrowth within breast tissue and it ypically affects women of reproductive age. Clinically, PASH can present as a palpable concern.  On histology, it is characterized by the presence of open slit-like spaces in dense collagenous stroma which are lined by a discontinuous layer of flat, spindle-shaped myofibroblasts with bland nuclei and contains complex anastomosing spaces that may be confused with an angiosarcoma.  PASH can be a focal microscopic incidental finding at breast biopsy or nodular (tumor-like). Mammographically, it commonly presents as a non-calcified, circumscribed, or partially circumscribed mass.  The appearance of asymmetric breast tissue or no direct imaging correlate has also been reported.  Sonographically, it commonly presents as a circumscribed oval hypoechoic mass, sometimes with a cystic component. Less commonly appearance can present as a heterogeneously echogenic area with irregular or poorly defined borders as illustrated in this case.  On MRI, it has variable T1 and T2 signal intensity and both mass and non-mass enhancements have been reported with persistent to plateau delayed enhancement pattern.  Nodular PASH can grow over time but it is not associated with malignancy and is not considered a premalignant lesions.  Surgical excision is recommended only in discordant cases.

Figure 2 - Axial T1-weighted fat suppressed post-contrast images during the 

a) early and 
b) delayed phases of enhancement demonstrate progressive centripetal enhancement.

**Teaching points**:  

“Picture frame” enhancement is a description of a particular pattern of background parenchymal enhancement where there is preferential early enhancement at the periphery of the breast tissue with progressive centripetal and anterior enhancement.  The term “vascular inflow” has also been used to describe the pattern because this variable enhancement of the breast parenchyma spatially and temporally is due to the arterial supply of the breast. The breast’s arterial supply enters at its periphery through branches and perforators derived from the internal thoracic artery, the thoracoacromial artery, the lateral thoracic artery, and the intercostal arteries. Individual variation in anatomy and cardiovascular status would be expected to introduce further variation in this pattern of enhancement.  “Picture frame” enhancement is often appreciated on the earliest contrast-enhanced images at the superior and inferior periphery of the breast on the sagittal images or at the medial, lateral, and posterior peripheral aspects of the breast on the axial images. 

The fifth edition of the ACR BI-RADS Atlas, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, now recommends that the amount of background parenchymal enhancement be included in the MRI report section for overall description of the breast composition with the use of the categories “minimal”, “mild”, “moderate”, and “marked” to describe the volume and intensity of the BPE. A note should also be made of symmetry or asymmetry. The authors acknowledge that there exist variations of distribution and morphology in BPE but they defer recommending description of these until more data becomes available. Research into the association of BPE with breast cancer risk or the affect of BPE on the performance of MRI has generally focused on the amount of BPE rather than morphology or pattern of BPE. Any such additional reporting of the pattern of enhancement is considered optional. 

Enhancement that is clearly ascribable to BPE based on the symmetry of the enhancement and pattern of distribution, such as the “picture frame” enhancement in this case, may be considered benign.

a-d) Serial axial T1-weighted post-contrast images from superior to inferior show a wedge-shaped mass (arrows) in the far posterior medial right breast with minimal enhancement and similar signal characteristics to the adjacent pectoralis musculature.  This represents a sternalis muscle..  

**Teaching points**:

The sternalis muscle is a variant of the chest wall musculature. It may be visible as a rounded or irregular flame shaped density on the craniocaudal mammogram along the sternal edge. As long as the radiologist is aware of the entity, there is usually little confusion. However, the muscle has a variety of appearances that can mimic malignancy as illustrated in this case.  This benign etiology can be confirmed by a cross-sectional imaging modality such as CT or MR imaging.
