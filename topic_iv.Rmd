Figure 2 - Incidental T8 vertebral compression fractureon bone scan

a) Anterior and 
b) lateral Tc99m-MDP bone scan delayed images demonstrate increased radiotracer uptake in T8 (arrows) correlating with the MRI finding, compatible with acute or subacute fracture. 

**Teaching Points**: 

Localizing images of the breast, performed in axial, coronal and sagittal plains, are initially performed to evaluate for optimal positioning and to ensure full coverage of both breasts and axillae. In addition to positioning, portions of the lungs, mediastinum, chest wall, spine and upper abdomen can be visualized and evaluated on these images. A large spectrum of abnormalities are possible, from benign pleural effusion with minimal effect on the clinical management, to extensive metastatic involvement of lymph nodes, bone or organs which has a significant impact on diagnostic work-up and disease management. We demonstrate an example of a screening MRI for a high risk young woman that detected a compression fracture of T8 spine, on the localizing scout images, confirmed to be pathologic on subsequent biopsy.
