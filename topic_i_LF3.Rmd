Figure -

a) Sagittal fat-suppressed T1 and 
b) T2-weightedimages demonstrate an irregular T2 hyperintense collection (black arrowheads) with a thick heterogeneous signal rim (white arrowheads) and thickening and edema of the overlying skin (white arrowhead).  Multiple punctate signal voids (black arrows) are present, reflectingair bubbles
c) Sagittal T1-weighted fat-suppressed post-contrast image demonstrates thick rim enhancement (white arrows) with progressive enhancement kinetics on 
d) CAD color overlay.

**Teaching Points**: 

Breast abscess can result from unresolved local infection, obstruction of the duct near the nipple and acute, chronic or lactational mastitis. They are usually palpable, often associated with erythema, edema, and induration or overlying skin and pain.

Depending on the water content of the collection, MR T2-weighted signal may vary. The overlying thickened skin may be intermediate or bright in signal depending on the degree of edema. Post contrast T1-weighted images usually demonstrate a nonenhancing central, round or irregular mass surrounded by an early intensely enhancing rim.  Please note that abscess may be confused with malignancy because the enhancement kinetics of the rim and the thickening of the overlying skin. Therefore, if an atypical clinical course was suspected, a breast biopsy or skin punch biopsy should be promptly performed to exclude inflammatory breast carcinoma.

Figure 
a) Sagittal post-contrast 3D MIP image of the left breast demonstrates minimal background parenchymal enhancement. 
b) Sagittal post-contrast 3D MIP image of the right breast demonstrates mild background parenchymal enhancement.
c) Sagittal post-contrast 3D MIP image of the right breast demonstrates moderate background parenchymal enhancement.
d) Sagittal post-contrast 3D MIP image of the right breast demonstrates marked background parenchymal enhancement.


**Teaching points**:  
The fifth edition of the ACR BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) Atlas, recommends the amount of BPE be categorized in the MRI report as “minimal”, “mild”, “moderate”, and “marked” to describe the volume and intensity of the BPE. Research into the association of BPE and breast cancer risk indicates likely increased risk for breast cancer which may be as high (3-4x) as more established risk associated with mammographic dense breasts.

##b9 brca cellulitis

History: 51-year-old woman undergoing high risk screening MRI. 

(a)<img src="images/LF3/b9_brca_cellulitis/1A.tif" style="width:40%">
(b)<img src="images/LF3/b9_brca_cellulitis/a1B.tif" style="width:40%">

Figure:

a) Large field of view axial T2-weighted fat-suppressed and 
b) post-contrast subtraction images demonstrate edema and subcutaneous enhancement in the right lateral breast (arrows).  

**Teaching Points**: 

Our case demonstrates an abnormal signal along the skin in the region of the right axillary tail with associated underlying prominent lymph nodes which was consistent with focal area of cellulitis.  It is important to correlate clinically, specifically in high risk patients, with history and physical examination to exclude malignancy.  If an atypical presentation was suspected, punch biopsy should be obtained. 
Also noted in this case, signal void artifact caused by an oversized field of view (FOV). Optimally, FOV should be limited to the area of the breasts while ensuring adequate coverage of the area of interest.  A small FOV may reduce signal, results in inadequate coverage of breast tissue leading to wraparound artifact. Conversely, an oversized FOV will increase pixel size, includes extramammary organs in the examination and results in signal void artifact within the thorax.

## b9 hem duct
History: 44-year-old woman undergoing high risk screening breast MRI.

Figure - Intraductal proteinaceous/hemorrhagic material

a) Sagittal T1-weighted fat-suppressed pre-contrast image demonstrates segmentally distributed linear high signal (arrows) in the lower breast. Although one could mistake the high signal in this region on 
b) the sagittal T1-weighted fat-suppressed post-contrast image for enhancement
c) the post-contrast subtraction image shows that no enhancement is actually present..

**Teaching Points**: 

Normal ducts are usually invisible on MR imaging as they blend in within the background parenchyma. In cases of inflammation, infection or obstruction, protein or blood filled ducts will be visible on non-enhanced T1-weighted images as high-signal-intensity branching tubular structures without an associated enhancement.  Therefore, subtraction images are very helpful and must be reviewed when pre-contrast images demonstrate hyperintense ductal pattern to exclude abnormal enhancement. Otherwise, subtle areas of ductal wall enhancement may be overlooked and a potential underlying carcinoma can be missed.

#b9 lipoma

History:  46-year-old woman with a palpable right breast lump and a  negative mammographic and sonographic workup. MRI was performed for further evaluation.

Figure

a) Sagittal T1-weighted  image of the right breast shows an oval circumscribed mass (arrow) that is isointense to fat. The fat suppressed images 
b) sagittal T2-weighted fat-suppressed
c) sagittal T1-weighted fat-suppressed post-contrast, and 
d) axial T1-weighted fat-suppressed post-contrast] all show the mass to be hypointense to the breast fat.
* Post-contrast images (c,d) show it to non-enhancing. Post lumptectomy changes are incidentally noted in the left breast.


**Teaching points**: 

Lipomas are one of the most common mesenchymal tumors that closely resemble fat and can occur in almost any part of the body. In addition to fat, lipomas may contain internal fibrous connective tissue. Lipomas are benign encapsulated masses occurring in 2.1 per 100 people. Clinically, lipomas are usually small and asymptomatic, but may be large enough to present as a clinical mass or cause breast asymmetry and enlargement. Diagnostic dilemmas can arise as lipomas may be difficult to appreciate in fatty breast tissue. Lipomas will typically be radiolucent on radiography/mammography, hyperechoic on ultrasound and fat attenuation on CT. On MRI, lipomas will mirror signal intensity of fat on all pulse sequences and will not contrast enhance, with exception of the surrounding fibrous capsule as illustrated on this case.

Figure: 39-year-old woman undergoing high risk screening breast MRI. 

a, b) Sequential axial T1-weighted fat-suppressed post-contrast images demonstrate a homogeneously enhancing mass (arrows) in the outer right breast, which appears oval on one slice and  reniform on the next . The reniform appearance is characteristic of a lymph node
c) A sagittal T1-weighted fat-suppressed post-contrast image through the mass highlights its homogeneous enhancment and reniform shape (arrow). The lymph node (arrows) has low signal on the 
d) T1-weighted image and high signal on the 
e) T2-weighted fat-suppressed image. Its central notch (arrow heads) is isointense to fat on both sequences
f) CAD enhancement kinetics analysis demonstrates a mixed progressive and washout enhancement pattern color coded as yellow and red, respectively.

**Teaching points**: 

Intramammary lymph nodes are separate from the axillary lymph nodes and are completely surrounded by breast tissue, typically in the upper outer quadrant. Approximately 5% of patients undergoing mammography and up to 28% of breast specimens will exhibit these lymph nodes. Characteristic features of a normal intramammary node include a fatty hilum, diameter less than 1 cm, and well circumscribed margins.  An intramammary lymph node may become abnormal and lose its hilum or enlarge secondary to hyperplasia, metastatic disease or inflammation. The MRI appearance of a benign intramammary lymph node is a reniform morphology with fatty hilum. The cortex will be T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense with rapid, homogeneous enhancement; a type III washout kinetic pattern can be seen as demonstrated in this case.

Figure 2 

a,b) Corresponding supine CT images obtained the next day show resolution of the round atelectasiswith some residual scarring (arrows).

**Teaching points**: 

Rounded atelectasis is an uncommon form of peripheral lung collapse that can be associated with asbestos exposure, exudative pleural effusions, post cardiac surgery, pneumothorax or be idiopathic. Rounded atelectasis is usually asymptomatic with minimal to no clinical findings. The two main conditions that rounded atelectasis is encountered is usually incidentally on a healthy patient or on long-term follow up of an asbestos-exposed patient. The typical imaging appearance is a peripheral round, spindle or wedge-shaped opacity with indistinct, irregular borders on radiography. On CT, it will appear as a peripheral round mass adjacent to thickened pleura. Variable contrast enhancement is noted and a classic “comet-tail” sign may be appreciated, composed of swirling confluence of pulmonary vessels. On MRI, rounded atelectasis will be T1 hyperintense to muscle and T1 hypointense to fat and T2 iso to hypotintense to fat with contrast enhancement and “comet-tail” sign, similar to CT. This case illustrates rounded atelectasis with “comet-tail” sign on MRI, likely secondary to a combination of prior scarring in the right middle lobe and prone position. The finding resolved on CT performed the next day with the patient positioned supine; only mild scarring was noted.

##b9 SF and SA

History: 36-year-old patient undergoing high risk screening breast MRI. 

(a)<img src="images/LF3/b9_SFSA/a1a.tif" style="width:40%">
(b)<img src="images/LF3/b9_SFSA/a1b.tif" style="width:40%">


Figure

a) Sagittal post-contrast subtraction images without and 
b) with CAD color overlay demonstrate two irregular masses (arrows) in the central right breast with mixed enhancement kinetics. No sonographic correlate was identified.

**Teaching Points**: 

Sclerosing adenosis (SA) and stromal fibrosis (SF) are benign entities that are known to mimic malignancy on clinical examination and radiological imaging. Sclerosing adenosis is present in 12% of benign surgical biopsies. It demonstrates increased numbers of distorted lobules usually accompanied by stromal fibrosis. Mammographically, sclerosing adenosis typically presents as amorphous and pleomorphic calcifications, however it does not seem to present distinctive features on contrast enhanced MRI. Lesions may be depicted as ductal enhancement or as a homogeneously-enhancing oval or round mass with lobulated or angular margins showing rapid early enhancement and delayed persistent or washout kinetics. 
Stromal Fibrosis, on the other hand is defined as proliferation of fibrous tissue replacing normal connective tissue and causing obliteration and atrophy of mammary ducts and lobules. SF has a more variable mammographic and sonographic appearance. Most prevalent MRI features are described in the literature to be round or oval shape, irregular or spiculated margins, rapid or medium rate of initial contrast uptake, and plateau or washout curves.
No further treatment required for either diagnosis if the pathology is concordant with the imaging findings.
