</ol>
<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Simple cysts result from dilatation and effacement of the terminal duct lobular unit. They are commonly seen incidentally on MRI and follow fluid signal on all sequences (appear very hyperintense on T2-weighted images and intermediate to low on T1-weighted images). On postcontrast images, cysts do not typically enhance, however, the periphery of the cyst may enhance if there is surrounding cystic inflammation. Not infrequently, may have intermediate or high signal on T1-weighted images due to contents of proteinaceous contents or blood products.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Normal ducts are usually invisible on breast MRI. However, in the setting of a chronic obstructive process, they become dilated and present as high signal intensity branching tubular structures on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images (due to proteinaceous or hemorrhagic material). Dilated ducts do not typically enhance, however, enhancement of the ductal wall maybe seen due to underlying inflammation. It is important to remember that assessment of enhancement should not depend merely on the subtracted images as misregistration artifact may occur.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Fibroadenomas are frequently seen on breast MRI and are best evaluated by their morphologic appearance. A classic benign feature is a smooth margin with hypointense internal septa on T2-weighted images. Less than 40% of Fibroadenomas demonstrate nonenhancing internal septations which, if present can be predictive of their benignity (&gt;95%). MRI enhancement kinetics alone is neither specific nor sensitive due to the overlap in enhancement characteristics between benign and malignant lesions. Therefore, kinetics can only be helpful if benign features are present.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Fibrocystic change (FCC) is a common benign condition, most often bilateral, that affects more than 50% of women. Fibrocystic parenchyma, like normal parenchyma, has a variable appearance dependent on the water and collagen content of the tissues. It might present as a discrete mass or density mimicking tumor in which case, both mammography and sonography are considered unreliable. On breast MRI, Fibrocystic change is usually difficult to distinguish from normal breast tissue on both T2W and T2W noncontrast images. However, on dynamic contrast enhanced images, it usually demonstrates scattered foci of regional enhancement with progressive kinetic analysis (Fig.1 a-c).</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>When performing MRI of the breast, systematic evaluation of other anatomic structures and organs contained within the field-of-view is important. Incidental findings are not uncommon on breast MRI; about one in five patients will have an extramammary finding. Gallstones are found in about 10% of the general population and twice as common in women as in men. They are more prevalent with increasing age and often detected incidentally. According to a recent study by Niell et al, gallstones were found to represent approximately 2% of all benign extramammary findings that required no additional work up. They are best appreciated at T2-weighted MR images and localizing sequences.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Normal intramammary lymph nodes are usually seen as oval or reniform, smoothly marginated fat containing masses. They are often seen adjacent to vessels within the upper outer quadrant, although 28% of intramammary lymph nodes are found in other locations. They are usually nonpalpable and found incidentally on breast MRI where they appear hyperintense on T2-weighted images. They typically demonstrate homogenous enhancement with rapid initial and washout delayed kinetics. Non-fat saturated T1-weighted images are usually helpful to confirm the presence of fat within the hilum.</p>
<p>Biopsy can be avoided if the mass demonstrates classic characteristics of a benign lymph node in patients who have no increased risk for malignancy.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>: When performing MRI of the breast, systematic evaluation of other anatomic structures and organs contained within the field-of-view is important. Incidental findings are not uncommon on breast MRI; about one in five patients will have an extramammary finding. Pericardial cysts are rare mediastinal cysts occurring with an incidence of 1 in 100,000. The majority of them is asymptomatic and arises in the anterior cardiophrenic angle, more frequently on the right side. Mediastinal cystic lesions constitute about 3% of all benign extramammary findings found on Breast MRI, as observed by Dr. Niell, where no additional assessment is indicated.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 11 (A-D), pericardial cyst, like any other mediastinal cyst, appears thin walled with classic cystic features of low signal intensity on T1-weighted and a homogenous hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images.</p>

<p>Phyllodes tumors are rare and constitute 0.3-1.0% of all breast tumors. They have a high incidence of local recurrence after surgery and potential for hematogenous metastases. Due to their rapid growth, Phyllodes tumors tend to have well-circumscribed margins on mammography and sonography which makes it difficult to distinguish from Fibroadenomas on the basis of imaging. Large Phyllodes tumors have a characteristic morphologic appearance on breast MRI including smooth margins, internal cysts and septations. They typically demonstrate low T1-weighted signal intensity and appear somewhat bright on the T2-weighted images. Literature has shown that contrast enhancement pattern can be variable and therefore, differentiation of Phyllodes and Fibroadenomas on breast MRI remains unreliable.</p>

<p>Implant rupture is a well-known complication after surgery and is the main cause of implant removal. Most ruptures have no obvious traumatic origin and sometimes occur in asymptomatic patients. MRI is generally accepted as the technique of choice for evaluating implant integrity of silicone implant, with a sensitivity of 70-94% and a specificity of 85-100%. Patients with saline implant rupture usually report an obvious change in size with extrusion of the fluid for which breast MRI is not recommended. Saline implants follow fluid signal on all sequences and have a valve to allow volume adjustment, which helps identify them on MRI. In our case example (A-D), saline rupture was incidentally found on a screening MRI for a high risk woman demonstrating complete collapse of the implant.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>Phase-encoded motion artifact is commonly seen in breast imaging due to physical movement of the patient and manifests as ghosting in the direction of phase encoding, which is usually in the direction of short axis of the image as illustrated in this case. The spacing between these artifacts is related to the TR and frequency of the motion. Unlike Gibbs or truncation artifacts, the motion artifacts usually extend across the entire FOV as illustrated in this case. Possible solutions to phase-encoded motion artifact include cardiac / respiratory gating, switching phase and frequency directions, increasing the number of signal averages and shortening the scan time when motion is from patient moving.</p>

<p>Fat necrosis is a process involving a cascade of cellular events starting with tissue injury. Fat cells undergo liquefaction necrosis, increased vascularization and infiltration of fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. Subsequently, there is proliferation of foreign body giant cells with fibrosis. The focus of fat necrosis may be replaced with a scar or persist as an oil cyst walled off by fibrous tissue. Fat necrosis of the breast is commonly seen secondary to breast procedures and surgery. Clinically, fat necrosis may be palpable at the site of injury. Mammographically, oils cysts can be seen as well as peripherally located calcifications creating the appearance of lucent “bubbles”. Calcifications typically coarsen as fat necrosis evolves. However, the appearance early fat necrosis and malignancy can overlap with an ill-defined and spiculated mass-like area and calcifications that mimic DCIS. Sonographically, the appearance of fat necrosis is variable from a well-defined hypoechoic mass likely representing an oil cyst to an irregular hypoechoic mass. It’s important to evaluate the sonographic images in the context of mammographic findings. On breast MRI, typical appearance of fat necrosis is peripheral enhancement surrounding central fat, best delineated on T1 non-fat saturated images as illustrated in this case. However, the evolving fat necrosis can have a variable appearance and comparison to prior imaging studies as well as surgical history is important. When imaging features are indeterminate and clinical history is unclear, core biopsy is appropriate. Fat necrosis can be a benign concordant finding for most indeterminate MRI lesions and usually do not require surgical excision.</p>

<p>Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a benign form of stromal (mesenchymal) overgrowth within breast tissue and it ypically affects women of reproductive age. Clinically, PASH can present as a palpable concern. On histology, it is characterized by the presence of open slit-like spaces in dense collagenous stroma which are lined by a discontinuous layer of flat, spindle-shaped myofibroblasts with bland nuclei and contains complex anastomosing spaces that may be confused with an angiosarcoma. PASH can be a focal microscopic incidental finding at breast biopsy or nodular (tumor-like). Mammographically, it commonly presents as a non-calcified, circumscribed, or partially circumscribed mass. The appearance of asymmetric breast tissue or no direct imaging correlate has also been reported. Sonographically, it commonly presents as a circumscribed oval hypoechoic mass, sometimes with a cystic component. Less commonly appearance can present as a heterogeneously echogenic area with irregular or poorly defined borders as illustrated in this case. On MRI, it has variable T1 and T2 signal intensity and both mass and non-mass enhancements have been reported with persistent to plateau delayed enhancement pattern. Nodular PASH can grow over time but it is not associated with malignancy and is not considered a premalignant lesions. Surgical excision is recommended only in discordant cases.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>“Picture frame” enhancement is a description of a particular pattern of background parenchymal enhancement where there is preferential early enhancement at the periphery of the breast tissue with progressive centripetal and anterior enhancement. The term “vascular inflow” has also been used to describe the pattern because this variable enhancement of the breast parenchyma spatially and temporally is due to the arterial supply of the breast. The breast’s arterial supply enters at its periphery through branches and perforators derived from the internal thoracic artery, the thoracoacromial artery, the lateral thoracic artery, and the intercostal arteries. Individual variation in anatomy and cardiovascular status would be expected to introduce further variation in this pattern of enhancement. “Picture frame” enhancement is often appreciated on the earliest contrast-enhanced images at the superior and inferior periphery of the breast on the sagittal images or at the medial, lateral, and posterior peripheral aspects of the breast on the axial images.</p>
<p>The fifth edition of the ACR BI-RADS Atlas, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, now recommends that the amount of background parenchymal enhancement be included in the MRI report section for overall description of the breast composition with the use of the categories “minimal”, “mild”, “moderate”, and “marked” to describe the volume and intensity of the BPE. A note should also be made of symmetry or asymmetry. The authors acknowledge that there exist variations of distribution and morphology in BPE but they defer recommending description of these until more data becomes available. Research into the association of BPE with breast cancer risk or the affect of BPE on the performance of MRI has generally focused on the amount of BPE rather than morphology or pattern of BPE. Any such additional reporting of the pattern of enhancement is considered optional.</p>
<p>Enhancement that is clearly ascribable to BPE based on the symmetry of the enhancement and pattern of distribution, such as the “picture frame” enhancement in this case, may be considered benign.</p>

<p>The sternalis muscle is a variant of the chest wall musculature. It may be visible as a rounded or irregular flame shaped density on the craniocaudal mammogram along the sternal edge. As long as the radiologist is aware of the entity, there is usually little confusion. However, the muscle has a variety of appearances that can mimic malignancy as illustrated in this case. This benign etiology can be confirmed by a cross-sectional imaging modality such as CT or MR imaging.</p>

<p>Depending on the water content of the collection, MR T2-weighted signal may vary. The overlying thickened skin may be intermediate or bright in signal depending on the degree of edema. Post contrast T1-weighted images usually demonstrate a nonenhancing central, round or irregular mass surrounded by an early intensely enhancing rim. Please note that abscess may be confused with malignancy because the enhancement kinetics of the rim and the thickening of the overlying skin. Therefore, if an atypical clinical course was suspected, a breast biopsy or skin punch biopsy should be promptly performed to exclude inflammatory breast carcinoma.</p>

The fifth edition of the ACR BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) Atlas, recommends the amount of BPE be categorized in the MRI report as “minimal”, “mild”, “moderate”, and “marked” to describe the volume and intensity of the BPE. Research into the association of BPE and breast cancer risk indicates likely increased risk for breast cancer which may be as high (3-4x) as more established risk associated with mammographic dense breasts.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Our case demonstrates an abnormal signal along the skin in the region of the right axillary tail with associated underlying prominent lymph nodes which was consistent with focal area of cellulitis. It is important to correlate clinically, specifically in high risk patients, with history and physical examination to exclude malignancy. If an atypical presentation was suspected, punch biopsy should be obtained. Also noted in this case, signal void artifact caused by an oversized field of view (FOV). Optimally, FOV should be limited to the area of the breasts while ensuring adequate coverage of the area of interest. A small FOV may reduce signal, results in inadequate coverage of breast tissue leading to wraparound artifact. Conversely, an oversized FOV will increase pixel size, includes extramammary organs in the examination and results in signal void artifact within the thorax.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Normal ducts are usually invisible on MR imaging as they blend in within the background parenchyma. In cases of inflammation, infection or obstruction, protein or blood filled ducts will be visible on non-enhanced T1-weighted images as high-signal-intensity branching tubular structures without an associated enhancement. Therefore, subtraction images are very helpful and must be reviewed when pre-contrast images demonstrate hyperintense ductal pattern to exclude abnormal enhancement. Otherwise, subtle areas of ductal wall enhancement may be overlooked and a potential underlying carcinoma can be missed.</p>

<p>Lipomas are one of the most common mesenchymal tumors that closely resemble fat and can occur in almost any part of the body. In addition to fat, lipomas may contain internal fibrous connective tissue. Lipomas are benign encapsulated masses occurring in 2.1 per 100 people. Clinically, lipomas are usually small and asymptomatic, but may be large enough to present as a clinical mass or cause breast asymmetry and enlargement. Diagnostic dilemmas can arise as lipomas may be difficult to appreciate in fatty breast tissue. Lipomas will typically be radiolucent on radiography/mammography, hyperechoic on ultrasound and fat attenuation on CT. On MRI, lipomas will mirror signal intensity of fat on all pulse sequences and will not contrast enhance, with exception of the surrounding fibrous capsule as illustrated on this case.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>Intramammary lymph nodes are separate from the axillary lymph nodes and are completely surrounded by breast tissue, typically in the upper outer quadrant. Approximately 5% of patients undergoing mammography and up to 28% of breast specimens will exhibit these lymph nodes. Characteristic features of a normal intramammary node include a fatty hilum, diameter less than 1 cm, and well circumscribed margins. An intramammary lymph node may become abnormal and lose its hilum or enlarge secondary to hyperplasia, metastatic disease or inflammation. The MRI appearance of a benign intramammary lymph node is a reniform morphology with fatty hilum. The cortex will be T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense with rapid, homogeneous enhancement; a type III washout kinetic pattern can be seen as demonstrated in this case.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>Rounded atelectasis is an uncommon form of peripheral lung collapse that can be associated with asbestos exposure, exudative pleural effusions, post cardiac surgery, pneumothorax or be idiopathic. Rounded atelectasis is usually asymptomatic with minimal to no clinical findings. The two main conditions that rounded atelectasis is encountered is usually incidentally on a healthy patient or on long-term follow up of an asbestos-exposed patient. The typical imaging appearance is a peripheral round, spindle or wedge-shaped opacity with indistinct, irregular borders on radiography. On CT, it will appear as a peripheral round mass adjacent to thickened pleura. Variable contrast enhancement is noted and a classic “comet-tail” sign may be appreciated, composed of swirling confluence of pulmonary vessels. On MRI, rounded atelectasis will be T1 hyperintense to muscle and T1 hypointense to fat and T2 iso to hypotintense to fat with contrast enhancement and “comet-tail” sign, similar to CT. This case illustrates rounded atelectasis with “comet-tail” sign on MRI, likely secondary to a combination of prior scarring in the right middle lobe and prone position. The finding resolved on CT performed the next day with the patient positioned supine; only mild scarring was noted.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Sclerosing adenosis (SA) and stromal fibrosis (SF) are benign entities that are known to mimic malignancy on clinical examination and radiological imaging. Sclerosing adenosis is present in 12% of benign surgical biopsies. It demonstrates increased numbers of distorted lobules usually accompanied by stromal fibrosis. Mammographically, sclerosing adenosis typically presents as amorphous and pleomorphic calcifications, however it does not seem to present distinctive features on contrast enhanced MRI. Lesions may be depicted as ductal enhancement or as a homogeneously-enhancing oval or round mass with lobulated or angular margins showing rapid early enhancement and delayed persistent or washout kinetics. Stromal Fibrosis, on the other hand is defined as proliferation of fibrous tissue replacing normal connective tissue and causing obliteration and atrophy of mammary ducts and lobules. SF has a more variable mammographic and sonographic appearance. Most prevalent MRI features are described in the literature to be round or oval shape, irregular or spiculated margins, rapid or medium rate of initial contrast uptake, and plateau or washout curves. No further treatment required for either diagnosis if the pathology is concordant with the imaging findings.</p>
