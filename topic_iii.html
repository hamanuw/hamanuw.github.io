<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Pregnancy associated breast carcinoma (PABC) is a rare occurrence with an estimated frequency of 2.3 cases per 100,000 deliveries and represents up to 3% of all breast malignancies. The diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy is a challenging situation for the patient and the clinician because it involves both the mother and the fetus. The hormone-induced changes that occur in breast tissue during pregnancy and lactation is a major cause of delay in diagnosis of PABC, therefore, resulting in poorer outcome. Given its high sensitivity compared to mammography, ultrasound is considered the initial imaging test in symptomatic pregnant or lactating women. However, mammography should be almost always performed in adjunct to ultrasound to evaluate for the presence of accompanying features of malignancy such as microcalcifications. The radiologic features of PABC are similar to those of non-PABC. MR imaging in pregnant women should not be used routinely, although there is no known adverse effect of MRI on the fetus. In lactating women, the breast parenchyma shows diffuse increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images due to the fraction of mobile water in milk. Following contrast administration, lactational parenchyma demonstrates an initial rapid enhancement and a subsequent early plateau of enhancement. Tumors can be well visualized on the T2W sequence is these patients.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>In patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, breast MRI provides the best correlation with final surgical pathology compared to physical examination, mammography, and sonography and is one of the generally accepted indications for getting a breast MRI evaluation. However, MRI may overestimate or underestimate residual disease in approximately 29% of the patients. Neoadjuvant treatment can be effective in reducing locally advanced tumor and in certain cases breast conservation can become a surgical treatment option rather than mastectomy. In patients with a good response, in addition to the reduction in size of tumor, change in enhancement pattern to persistent from washout pattern as well overall decrease in the amount of background parenchymal enhancement have been noted, as illustrated in this case.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Paget Disease is a rare disease of the breast, accounting for 1-3% of all breast cancer cases. The disease is characterized by involvement of the nipple-areolar complex with malignant cells called Paget cells. This is manifested clinically by nipple/areolar itching, erythema, scaly skin, bloody nipple discharge, nipple erosion, ulceration, or retraction. Diagnosis is usually made by a full thickness punch biopsy of the nipple-areolar complex. Paget’s disease of the breast is nearly always a sign of underlying breast malignancy with most studies reporting the presence of a concurrent ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer, in over 90% of patients. Approximately 50% of patients with Paget disease also present with an associated palpable mass in the breast,90% of which are found to have invasive disease, whereas a lesion without a palpable mass is usually associated with DCIS. On Mammography, Paget disease can be seen as nipple/areolar abnormalities such as skin thickening, malignant calcifications or discrete lesions involving the nipple areolar complex or breast parenchyma. However, mammograms can appear completely normal in up to 50% of patients with Paget disease, therefore, correlation with clinical examination is considered critical. MR imaging is usually performed to detect underlying occult malignancy. Common MR findings of Paget disease include, asymmetric nipple enhancement and nodularity with or without associated features of DCIS and invasive carcinoma.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>MRI evaluation of breast carcinoma prior to surgical treatment may be useful in both mastectomy and breast conservation candidates to define the relationship of the tumor to the fascia and its extension into pectoralis major and chest wall. Invasion of the pectoralis muscle is either infiltrative or mass-like which should be easily distinguishable from smooth baseline muscle enhancement. Obliteration of the fat plane between tumor and muscle alone does not indicate muscle involvement. There must be associated focal enhancement of the muscle. The patient with tumor extension into the chest wall is usually considered stage T4 according to TNM classification and stage IIIB, which requires chest wall resection. Whereas invasion of the pectoralis major muscle alone, does not affect staging and may only require muscle resection at the time of surgery.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Two patterns of Pectoralis muscle involvement have been noted: infiltrative enhancement pattern with preservation of muscular architecture and a mass-like enhancement that expanded the pectoralis major muscle with loss of the muscle striations. As discussed earlier, invasion of the pectoralis major muscle alone does not affect staging and may only require muscle resection at the time of surgery. However, in our demonstrated case, the spiculated mass appears to extend posteriorly into the pectoralis muscles as well as the chest wall. Given the positive ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node, final stage was IIIC which is a non-operable stage with N3c classification.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>: Approximately 4% of patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer will have distant metastases at the time of presentation. Breast MRI localizer images with large FOV can sometimes indicate possible distant metastasis as illustrated in this case, prompting additional dedicated imaging and confirmation biopsy. The most common sites of distant metastasis for breast cancer are bone, lung, brain, and liver. Regardless of tumor size and nodal status, the presence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis indicates overall stage IV disease which has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 22%.</p>

<p>According to the seventh edition of the AJCC TNM classification, metastases to less than four non-matted, moveable level I or level II nodes is considered N1 disease. N2 disease, as we see in our case example, is defined as involvement of the ipsilateral internal mammary node in the absence of axillary metastases. This usually occurs in cases of deep or medial breast tumors and it may occur in 1%–5% of breast cancers.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>: Breast MRI can identify abnormal internal mammary lymph nodes that can impact clinical staging, planning of radiation therapy which in case of metastasis would require a wide field of irradiation. The N3 category, which includes metastases in the level III (infraclavicular) and supraclavicular nodal stations, is subdivided into subcategories N3a, N3b, and N3c. N3a includes metastases in the ipsilateral infraclavicular nodes with or without level I-II axillary involvement; N3b, ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node metastases with level I-II axillary nodal involvement; and N3c, ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node involvement with or without level I-II axillary involvement.</p>
<p>In our case, the patient was found to have an presumed metastatic internal mammary lymph node in addition to level I and II axillary lymph nodes which represents N3b.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>: MR imaging has been shown to affect clinical management in up to 50% of patients with ILC, leading to changes in surgical management in 28% of cases. Several published studies indicate pre-operative MRI is helpful in identifying and predicting clinically occult tumor involvement of the NAC. MRI-measured distance from the NAC, tumor size, subareolar/central location (as illustrated in this case) and unilateral enhancement of the nipple with continuous enhancement from the index lesion are correlated with increased risk of NAC involvement.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>MRI evaluation of breast carcinoma prior to surgical treatment may be useful in both mastectomy and breast conservation candidates to define the relationship of the tumor to the fascia and its extension into pectoralis major and chest wall. Invasion of the pectoralis muscle is either infiltrative or mass-like which should be easily distinguishable from smooth baseline muscle enhancement. Obliteration of the fat plane between tumor and muscle alone does not indicate muscle involvement. The patient with tumor extension into the chest wall is usually considered stage T4 according to TNM classification and stage IIIB, which requires chest wall resection. Whereas invasion of the pectoralis major muscle alone, does not affect staging and may only require muscle resection at the time of surgery.</p>

<p>Triple Receptor Negative Cancer is a distinctive subgroup of breast cancer that is negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), accounting for 11-20% of all breast cancer types. It’s associated with basal molecular subtype. Patients with triple negative tumors have poorer clinical outcome with higher rates of recurrence and distant metastasis. Sonographically, triple negative tumors can mimic benign fibroadenoma or a complicated cyst. MR imaging, usually presents as a unifocal necrotic mass with heterogeneous rim enhancement, and central high signal intensity on T2-weighted representing necrotic content as in this case.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Tubular carcinoma of the breast is a well-differentiated form of invasive ductal carcinoma. It typically occurs in young women aged middle to late 40s and tends to have a more favorable prognosis than other breast cancers. Pure tubular carcinoma is rare and accounts for less than 2% of all breast cancers. Although it may contain other histologic elements, a minimum percentage of tubular elements required to make the diagnosis of tubular carcinoma ranges from 75% to 90%. Tubular carcinoma is often detected as a small spiculated mass on screening mammography, usually less than 1 cm, however it may be discovered as a palpable mass. Those spicules correspond to reactive stroma spreading out of the neoplasm. On MRI, tubular carcinoma appears similar to invasive ductal carcinoma-not otherwise specified with variable kinetic enhancement pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>Breast MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of clinically occult breast cancer in patients with malignant axillary adenopathy. Breast MRI can detect an otherwise mammographically and sonographically occult breast cancer in over 60% of patients. Routine application of breast MRI in occult breast cancer can impact clinical management including the possibility of breast conserving surgery. This is one of the generally accepted clinical indication for breast MRI.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>There is literature support for pre-operative MRI in patients with extremely dense and heterogeneously dense breasts. As illustrated in this case, the extensive malignancy is better delineated on the MRI compare to the mammogram in the setting of dense breasts. In addition, the sonographic findings were also vague without clear delineation of the extent of disease. The mastectomy specimen confirms the extent of disease best delineated by the breast MRI. It is important to note that breast MRI can also overestimate disease due to non-tumoral enhancement of the surrounding tissue related to inflammation and edema.</p>

<p>Breast MRI is commonly performed for extent of disease evaluation and pre-operative planning. However, it is currently not generally accepted by the surgical community due to unclear long term benefit in terms of patient survival outcome, especially in the setting of adjuvant chemo and radiation therapy. Breast MRI may be more important in patients who are relying only surgery for their treatment. In addition, there is literature support for performing pre-operative MRI in patients with invasive lobular cancer for better estimation of disease and additional finding especially in patients with dense breasts. This patient underwent wide excision yielding 8.2 cm of disease with negative margin on final pathology. Compared to the mammogram, the breast MRI gave more accurate estimation of disease in this case. It is important to note however that Breast MRI can over-estimate disease due to enhancement of tissue surrounding the tumor related to edema, inflammation and desmoplastic reaction. The invasive lobular carcinoma in this case demonstrated persistent benign appearing delayed enhancement pattern. This case illustrates the importance of utilizing morphology as the most important feature to be analyzed as kinetic enhancement pattern can be non-specific.</p>

<p>Figure 1. There is a focal asymmetry in the far posterior inferior and slightly medial right breast on (b) MLO and (d) CC mammographic views (arrows). The focal asymmetry persisted on the spot compression views (not shown) and ultrasound was performed for further evaluation. (See Figure 2.) An asymmetry (arrowhead) was also noted in the upper right breast without a definite correlate on the CC view, and no sonographic correlate was reported. (a) An asymmetry (arrow) is noted in the posterior lower left breast without a definite correlate on the CC view. The appearance was similar to prior mammograms, and the finding was considered benign.</p>
<p>Figure 2. Targeted right breast ultrasound demonstrates a 2.5 cm irregular hypoechoic mass along the 5:00 axis corresponding to the mammographic focal asymmetry. This mass underwent biopsy yielding invasive lobular carcinoma.</p>
<p>Figure 3. Sagittal T1-weighted post-contrast subtraction images of the right breast demonstrate (a) a 3.1 cm irregular mass (arrows) in the posterior 5:00 axis of the right breast with central localizing clip artifact (arrowhead), which yielded malignancy on biopsy.Additional suspicious enhancement is noted in (b) the retroareolar right breast (arrows) and (c,d) along the 10:00 -10:30 axis (arrows)..</p>
<p>Figure 4. Second look ultrasound was performed for the additional MRI findings. (a) Targeted ultrasound of the upper outer right breast shows 2 adjacent mildly hypoechoic masses likely corresponding to the areas of 10:00-10:30 MRI enhancement (and, in retrospect, to the mammographic asymmetry). (b) Targeted ultrasound of the retroareolar right breast demonstrates a hypoechoic mass likely corresponding to the subareolar MRI enhancement. The 10:00 mass underwent ultrasound guided biopsy yielding invasive lobular carcinoma. This proved multicentric disease, and the patient underwent mastectomy rather than lumpectomy.</p>

<p>Pre-operative breast MRI can detect additional cancers in ipsilateral breast in 20-30% of the cases and contralateral breast in 5% of the cases impacting clinical management, especially in patient with invasive lobular cancer and dense breasts as illustrated in this case. It is important to note that pathology confirmation is needed to document multicentric disease despite suspicious appearance of additional findings on MRI. Sonographic features of certain malignancies can be subtle and breast MRI can help better localize the finding as shown in this case.</p>

<p>Medullary carcinoma of the breast is a rare type of invasive ductal breast cancer and accounts for ~3% of all breast cancers and can occur in younger women including 10% of cases in women under 35 years. On histology, medullary carcinomas have been classified as either typical or atypical. Atypical medullary carcinomas are now classified as invasive ductal carcinomas with medullary features. Patients with medullary carcinoma have a more favorable prognosis than those with atypical medullary carcinoma and non-medullary carcinoma. The morphologic features of medullary carcinomas and fibroadenomas can overlap. Mammographically, medullary carcinoma is a round, ovoid or lobular mass with ill-defined or circumscribed margins. On ultrasound, the mass can be either homogeneously hypo-echoic or hypo-echoic with mild heterogeneity. Posterior acoustic enhancement may be present, On MRI, medullary carcinomas appeared as masses with an oval or lobular shape and circumscribed margins. The tumors were iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images and iso- or hyperintense on T2-weighted images relative to the surrounding breast tissue. Kinetics curve showed a rapid initial increase in enhancement and a washout or plateau delayed enhancement pattern. Many of the imaging features typical for medullary carcinoma were present in our case. The patient underwent breast conservation with final pathology; typical medullary carcinoma, stage T2,N0.</p>

<p>Mucinous carcinoma of the breast is a rare form (2% of all breast cancers) of invasive ductal carcinoma and is sometimes called colloid carcinoma. The tumor is made up of abnormal cells within pools of mucin, a key component in the slimy, slippery mucus. It can histologically divided into pure mucinous breast cancer or mixed mucinous breast cancer. Mucinous carcinoma is extremely rare in men and in women, more common after menopause in 60s or early 70s. Mammographically, the presence of mucin results in a low-density and relatively well-defined lobular mass. Sonographically, mixed cystic and solid components, posterior acoustic enhancement, and micro-lobulated margins are commonly seen. On MRI, they can have very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images as illustrated in this case, which relates to the water component in mucin. Post contrast enhancement can be variable. Typically, a pure mucinous sub type carries a better prognosis compared to invasive ductal carcinoma NOS. Mixed mucinous carcinoma of the breast tend to have a more aggressive behavior than pure sub-type as illustrated in this case with distant metastasis.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>In patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, breast MRI provides the best correlation with final surgical pathology compared to physical examination, mammography, and sonography and is one of the generally accepted indication for getting a breast MRI evaluation. However, MRI may overestimate (6%) or underestimate (23%) residual disease in approximately 29% of the patients.</p>
<p>RECIST guideline for tumor response: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the Longest Diameter (LD) of target lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions.</p>
<p>The patient in our case demonstrates partial response to neoadjuvant therapy and on final surgical pathology showed 1.9 cm residual tumor and 2 positive axillary lymph nodes. , Neoadjuvant treatment can be effective in reducing locally advanced tumor and in certain cases breast conservation can become a surgical treatment option rather than mastectomy.<br />
In patients with a good response, in addition to the reduction in size of tumor, change in enhancement pattern to persistent from washout pattern as well overall decrease in the amount of background parenchymal enhancement have been noted, as illustrated in this case.</p>

<p>Papillary carcinoma of the breast is a rare type of invasive ductal breast cancer and accounts for ~2% of all breast cancers and usually occurs in post menopausal women with average age of 65 years. Clinically can manifest as a palpable mass or nipple discharge occurring most commonly in the retro-areolar/sub-areolar location. Classified as papillary ductal carcinoma in situ, intracystic papillary carcinoma (ICPC) with or without invasion or solid papillary carcinoma (if no cystic component is present). Invasive elements are typically detected at the periphery of the lesion. Histologically, it is characterized by a frond-like growth pattern on a fibrovascular core lacking a myoepithelial layer. Mammographically, papillary carcinoma can present as a round, oval or lobulated mass with usually circumscribed margin. Sonographically, papillary carcinoma presents as a complex cystic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement or as hypoechoic solid mass. Increased vascularity is often present on color flow Doppler interrogation. On MRI, intracystic papillary carcinoma appears as complex cystic or multi-cystic masses with heterogeneous internal composition with enhancing nodular masses and variable fluid content. Hemorrhagic contents can be hyper-intense on both T1- and T2-weighted images and fluid-fluid levels may be seen as illustrated in our case. Serous contents can show T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity. Post contrast images can show variable enhancement involving the cyst walls, septa, and mural nodules. Patients with papillary carcinoma have a more favorable prognosis than those with invasive ductal carcinoma NOS.</p>

<p>Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous disease varying in clinical presentation, morphology and behavior. The published studies indicate that DCIS of all grades has the potential to progress to invasive ductal carcinoma. However high-grade DCIS has been shown to progress more rapidly than lower grade lesions and are more likely to lead to metastatic disease with poor survival outcome. The MRI appearance of natural progression of high grade DCIS is illustrated in this case demonstrating dramatic increase in loco-regional disease with parenchymal spread of tumor, skin involvement and axillary metastasis. Breast MRI is a sensitive modality for evaluating interval change of malignancy not only in successful neo-adjuvant therapy cases but also in cases of failed treatment.</p>

<p>Although mammography has been the mainstay for diagnosis of DCIS, there has been a tendency in underestimating the extension of disease, especially in patients without microcalcifications or in those with dense breasts or breast implants. MRI has been more sensitive in detecting pure DCIS compared to mammography. In many instances, MRI can reveal early stage breast cancer, including DCIS and DCIS with small invasive carcinomas, which are mammographically, sonographically, and clinically occult. However, no differences in MR morphologic or kinetic features have been reported between low grade and high grade DCIS.</p>
<p>In our example, linear distribution of calcifications were identified on mammography which correspond to linear nonmass enhancement on the T1W post contrast imagines, a finding that has been shown to be more likely associated with high-grade DCIS.</p>

<p>MRI has been shown to be more sensitive than mammography in detection of all grades of DCIS, with the highest sensitivity for detection of high-grade and intermediate-grade DCIS as compared with low-grade DCIS. Mammographically, low-grade DCIS present as amorphous calcifications on mammography and are more likely to present as a mass or asymmetry than high-grade DCIS. On MR imaging, non-mass enhancement is usually associated with all grades of DCIS (60%–81% of cases). Low-grade DCIS typically has benign blood flow enhancement kinetics, however, no individual kinetic pattern has been demonstrated to predict DCIS grade.</p>

<p>The nipple may be involved by extension of underlying invasive ductal carcinoma, by ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or by Paget cells within the epidermis. The incidence of clinically silent nipple involvement by cancer has been shown to be higher than that previously known, according to histopathologic examination of the nipple in mastectomy specimens. Therefore, it is important to rule out occult carcinoma within the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) site in patients undergoing nipple-sparing mastectomy.<br />
MRI-measured tumor size and distance from the NAC are correlated with increased risk of NAC involvement. With the advantages of preoperative MRI, it is possible to make a valid prediction of the extent of disease, and in particular, occult nipple invasion.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Breast MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of clinically occult breast cancer in patients with malignant axillary adenopathy. Breast MRI can detect an otherwise mammographically and sonographically occult breast cancer in over 60% of patients. Routine application of breast MRI in occult breast cancer can impact clinical management including the possibility of breast conserving surgery. This is one of the generally accepted clinical indications for breast MRI.</p>

<p>Multicentric disease (MCD) is defined as two or more tumor areas in different quadrants of the same breast. A number of studies have reported the capability of MRI to identify additional cancer foci that would have otherwise remained undetected on the basis of clinical assessment and conventional imaging, thereby, changing surgical planning. Data suggest that MCD may be more common in patients with certain molecular subtypes (luminal B and HER2), as illustrated in this case.</p>
<p>In patients with advanced breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases eligibility for breast conservation treatment by 46% in patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also effective in reducing burden of disease in the axilla and could potentially decrease the extent of axillary surgery.</p>
<p>It is important for the radiologist to review the pre-contrast nonfat saturated T1-weighted images for presence of fat within the rim enhancing lesions to help differentiate fat necrosis from additional malignant lesions.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Points</strong>:</p>
<p>Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histologic type of breast carcinoma, accounting for approximately 10%–15% of all invasive breast cancers. Its mammographic manifestation may vary and can be a vague finding such as architectural distortion or asymmetry. Higher false-negative rates (up to 19%) are reported for ILC than for other invasive cancers at mammography because ILC is often difficult to diagnose mammographically and therefore, disease extent may be underestimated.</p>
