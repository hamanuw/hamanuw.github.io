**Teaching Points**: 

Pregnancy associated breast carcinoma (PABC) is a rare occurrence with an estimated frequency of 2.3 cases per 100,000 deliveries and represents up to 3% of all breast malignancies. The diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy is a challenging situation for the patient and the clinician because it involves both the mother and the fetus. The hormone-induced changes that occur in breast tissue during pregnancy and lactation is a major cause of delay in diagnosis of PABC, therefore, resulting in poorer outcome. Given its high sensitivity compared to mammography, ultrasound is considered the initial imaging test in symptomatic pregnant or lactating women. However, mammography should be almost always performed in adjunct to ultrasound to evaluate for the presence of accompanying features of malignancy such as microcalcifications. The radiologic features of PABC are similar to those of non-PABC. MR imaging in pregnant women should not be used routinely, although there is no known adverse effect of MRI on the fetus.  In lactating women, the breast parenchyma shows diffuse increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images due to the fraction of mobile water in milk. Following contrast administration, lactational parenchyma demonstrates an initial rapid enhancement and a subsequent early plateau of enhancement. Tumors can be well visualized on the T2W sequence is these patients.

Figure 2 - 5 month follow-up MRI following neoadjuvant chemotherapy

a) Sagittal post-contrast subtraction image of the left breast at the location of the localizing clip (arrowhead) shows reduction of non-mass enhancement (arrows), now measuring up to 2.8 cm
b) The CAD enhancement kinetics overlay now shows the area to be predominantly blue, indicating mild uptake and progressive enhancement. Enlarged axillary lymph nodes from known metastatic disease had also decreased in size and resumed their normal morphology (not shown). Surgical pathology at the time of lumpectomy showed residual tumor measuring up to 2.5 cm and 2 positive axillary lymph nodes. 

**Teaching points**:

In patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, breast MRI provides the best correlation with final surgical pathology compared to physical examination, mammography, and sonography and is one of the generally accepted indications for getting a breast MRI evaluation.  However, MRI may overestimate or underestimate residual disease in approximately 29% of the patients. Neoadjuvant treatment can be effective in reducing locally advanced tumor and in certain cases breast conservation can become a surgical treatment option rather than mastectomy.  In patients with a good response, in addition to the reduction in size of tumor, change in enhancement pattern to persistent from washout pattern as well overall decrease in the amount of background parenchymal enhancement have been noted, as illustrated in this case.

**Teaching Points**: 

Paget Disease is a rare disease of the breast, accounting for 1-3% of all breast cancer cases. The disease is characterized by involvement of the nipple-areolar complex with malignant cells called Paget cells.  This is manifested clinically by nipple/areolar itching, erythema, scaly skin, bloody nipple discharge, nipple erosion, ulceration, or retraction.  Diagnosis is usually made by a full thickness punch biopsy of the nipple-areolar complex. Paget’s disease of the breast is nearly always a sign of underlying breast malignancy with most studies reporting the presence of a concurrent ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer, in over 90% of patients. Approximately 50% of patients with Paget disease also present with an associated palpable mass in the breast,90% of which are found to have invasive disease, whereas a lesion without a palpable mass is usually associated with DCIS.  On Mammography, Paget disease can be seen as nipple/areolar abnormalities such as skin thickening, malignant calcifications or discrete lesions involving the nipple areolar complex or breast parenchyma. However, mammograms can appear completely normal in up to 50% of patients with Paget disease, therefore, correlation with clinical examination is considered critical. MR imaging is usually performed to detect underlying occult malignancy. Common MR findings of Paget disease include, asymmetric nipple enhancement and nodularity with or without associated features of DCIS and invasive carcinoma.

Figure 1 - Left breast cancer with pectoralis muscle involvement

a) Sagittal T1-weighted FS image demonstrates an irregular mass (arrows)  abutting the pectoralis major muscle (arrow-heads). Skin thickening is noted (arrow-heads)
b,c,d) Selected sagittal post-contrast subtraction images demonstrate irregular homogeneously and heterogeneously enhancing masses (arrows) in the posterior third of the breast, some of which abut the expanded, enhancing pectoralis major muscle (arrow-heads). 

**Teaching Points**: 

MRI evaluation of breast carcinoma prior to surgical treatment may be useful in both mastectomy and breast conservation candidates to define the relationship of the tumor to the fascia and its extension into pectoralis major and chest wall. Invasion of the pectoralis muscle is either infiltrative or mass-like which should be easily distinguishable from smooth baseline muscle enhancement. Obliteration of the fat plane between tumor and muscle alone does not indicate muscle involvement. There must be associated focal enhancement of the muscle. 
The patient with tumor extension into the chest wall is usually considered stage T4 according to TNM classification and stage IIIB, which requires chest wall resection. Whereas invasion of the pectoralis major muscle alone, does not affect staging and may only require muscle resection at the time of surgery.

a) Axial CT and fused PET/CT images corroborate the findings with a large hypermetabolic left breast mass (teal oval) shown involving the underlying pectoralis major muscle
b) Coronal PET MIP image shows both thea hypermetabolic left breast mass (arrow) and a hypermetabolic ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node (arrowhead).  This was classified as N3c.

**Teaching Points**: 

Two patterns of Pectoralis muscle involvement have been noted:  infiltrative enhancement pattern with preservation of muscular architecture and a mass-like enhancement that expanded the pectoralis major muscle with loss of the muscle striations. As discussed earlier, invasion of the pectoralis major muscle alone does not affect staging and may only require muscle resection at the time of surgery. However, in our demonstrated case, the spiculated mass appears to extend posteriorly into the pectoralis muscles as well as the chest wall.  Given the positive ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node, final stage was IIIC which is a non-operable stage with N3c classification.

c) CAD enhancement kinetics analysis demonstrates a predominant washout pattern within the mass
d) Axial MRI localizer image and corresponding
e) Axial CT image demonstrate metastatic lesions within the liver (arrows).

**Teaching Points**: 
Approximately 4% of patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer will have distant metastases at the time of presentation.  Breast MRI localizer images with large FOV can sometimes indicate possible distant metastasis as illustrated in this case, prompting additional dedicated  imaging and confirmation biopsy.  The most common sites of distant metastasis for breast cancer are bone, lung, brain, and liver. Regardless of tumor size and nodal status, the presence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis indicates overall stage IV disease which has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 22%.

a) Post-contrast axial subtraction image demonstrates an enhancing irregular spiculated mass in the posterior right breast (arrows) with 
b) central washout on CAD enhancement kinetics analysis. This corresponds to the known malignancy
c) A more inferior T1-weighted FS post-contrast image shows a prominent right internal mammary lymph node (arrow) 
d) with mixed enhancement kinetics on  CAD analysis. Subsequently, the right internal mammary lymph node was identified on ultrasound and fine needle aspiration was performed yielding adenocarcinoma, compatible with breast cancer metastasis.


**Teaching Points**: 
Lymph node status and tumor size are the most important prognostic indicators.  Appropriate evaluation of regional lymph node status (N) is important for staging, treatment planning, and prognosis. 

According to the seventh edition of the AJCC TNM classification, metastases to less than four non-matted, moveable level I or level II nodes is considered N1 disease. N2 disease, as we see in our case example, is defined as involvement of the ipsilateral internal mammary node in the absence of axillary metastases. This usually occurs in cases of deep or medial breast tumors and it may occur in 1%–5% of breast cancers.

c) the hypermetabolic left internal mammary lymph node (green circle).


**Teaching points**: 
Breast MRI can identify abnormal internal mammary lymph nodes that can impact clinical staging, planning of radiation therapy which in case of metastasis would require a wide field of irradiation. 
The N3 category, which includes metastases in the level III (infraclavicular) and supraclavicular nodal stations, is subdivided into subcategories N3a, N3b, and N3c. N3a includes metastases in the ipsilateral infraclavicular nodes with or without level I-II axillary involvement; N3b, ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node metastases with level I-II axillary nodal involvement; and N3c, ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node involvement with or without level I-II axillary involvement. 

In our case, the patient was found to have an presumed metastatic internal mammary lymph node in addition to level I and II axillary lymph nodes which represents N3b.

**Teaching Points**: 
MR imaging has been shown to affect clinical management in up to 50% of patients with ILC, leading to changes in surgical management in 28% of cases.  Several published studies indicate pre-operative MRI is helpful in identifying and predicting clinically occult tumor involvement of the NAC.  MRI-measured distance from the NAC, tumor size, subareolar/central location (as illustrated in this case)  and unilateral enhancement of the nipple with continuous enhancement from the index lesion are correlated with increased risk of NAC involvement.

Triple Receptor Negative Cancer is a distinctive subgroup of breast cancer that is negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), accounting for 11-20% of all breast cancer types. It’s associated with basal molecular subtype.  Patients with triple negative tumors have poorer clinical outcome with higher rates of recurrence and distant metastasis. 
Sonographically, triple negative tumors can mimic benign fibroadenoma or a complicated cyst.  MR imaging, usually presents as a unifocal necrotic mass with heterogeneous rim enhancement, and central high signal intensity on T2-weighted representing necrotic content as in this case.

Figure 2 - 12-month follow-up MRI images demonstrating tubular carcinoma

a) Sagittal T2-weighted FS image of the right breast shows minimal T2 hyperintensity (arrow) in the posterior breast
b) Sagittal post-contrast subtraction image shows interval enlargement of the previously seen enhancing focus, which is now a heterogeneously enhancing, irregular, spiculated mass in the posterior right breast
c) CAD enhancement kinetics analysis shows a mixed enhancement pattern, predominantly washout, suspicious for malignancy. Biopsy yielded tubular carcinoma.

**Teaching Points**: 

Tubular carcinoma of the breast is a well-differentiated form of invasive ductal carcinoma.  It typically occurs in young women aged middle to late 40s and tends to have a more favorable prognosis than other breast cancers. Pure tubular carcinoma is rare and accounts for less than 2% of all breast cancers. Although it may contain other histologic elements, a minimum percentage of tubular elements required to make the diagnosis of tubular carcinoma ranges from 75% to 90%. 
Tubular carcinoma is often detected as a small spiculated mass on screening mammography, usually less than 1 cm, however it may be discovered as a palpable mass.  Those spicules correspond to reactive stroma spreading out of the neoplasm. On MRI, tubular carcinoma appears similar to invasive ductal carcinoma-not otherwise specified with variable kinetic enhancement pattern.
