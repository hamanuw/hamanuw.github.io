Figure 1 - Left extracapsular silicone implant rupture and right silicone implant radial fold

a,b) Selected axial T2-weighted FS images demonstrate collapse of the left silicone implant shell (white arrows) with extravasation of silicone into the fibrous capsule. The "linguini" sign (black arrow-heads) of intracapsular rupture is evident.  
c) More inferior T2-weighted FS axial image, there is extracapsular leak (white arrows) of silicone laterally into the soft tissue along the left chest wall. Complex radial folds (black arrow) are present involving the right silicone implant shell without evidence of right implant rupture.

**Teaching Points**: 

MR imaging can diagnose silicone breast implant rupture with a high sensitivity and specificity with a positive predictive value close to 99%.  Silicone implant ruptures are usually unnoticed by the patient because the free silicone is kept in place by the surrounding fibrous capsule, which begins forming immediately after surgery as a natural foreign body reaction. 

Extracapsular silicone implant rupture is defined as rupture of both the implant shell and the fibrous capsule, with macroscopic silicone leakage that extends beyond the fibrous capsule into surrounding tissues and rarely to distant body regions (Figure 1a-c). Intracapsular rupture is defined as rupture of the implant shell with microscopic silicone leakage beyond the fibrous capsule.  The commonly used “Linguine Sign” refers to the presence of multiple curvilinear low signal intensity lines within the silicone implant and it is considered the most reliable MRI characteristic for intracapsular rupture and is often seen with extracapsular implant ruptures. 

Radial folds, which are considered to be normal variants, are infoldings of the implant membrane into the silicone implant. On MRI, they appear as blind ending lines extending from the surface of the implant (Figure 1c).

Figure 1 - Intracapsular rupture of right double lumen implant

a) Axial T2-weighted water saturated and 
b) Sagittal T2-weighted images of the right breast demonstrate multiple low-intensity curvilinear lines (arrows) contained within the fibrous capsule, representing the collapsed implant shell (“linguine sign”). There is no extrusion of silicone beyond the fibrous capsule. This is compatible with an intra-capsular rupture

Figure 2 - Corresponding rupture of left double lumen implant

a) Axial T2-weighted water saturated and 
b) Sagittal T2-weighted  images  of the left breast demonstrate an intact double lumen implant for comparison. 

**Teaching Points**: 
Double-lumen implants are less commonly used. They typically have a fixed smaller outer lumen filled with saline surrounding a larger inner lumen of high signal-intensity silicone. A rupture diagnosis for a double lumen implant requires both membranes to be ruptured.

Figure 1 - Bilateral intracapsular silicone implant rupture

a) Sagittal T2-weighted water suppressed and 
b) Axial T2-weighted images of the right breast show a focus of silicone gel trapped within a fold of the implant shell, known as a “noose sign,” “inverted teardrop sign,” or “keyhole sign” (arrows)
c) Axial T2-weighted image of the left breast shows low signal intensity curvilinear lines contained within the fibrous capsule, representing the collapsed implant shell. These are signs of bilateral intracasular rupture

**Teaching Points**: 

Occasionally, a focal silicone gel leakage may occur through a small defect within the implant shell. On MRI, this appears as a focal silicone invagination between the inner shell and the fibrous capsule referred to as Noose sign, reversed teardrop sign or Key-hole sign. Please note that the two membranes do not touch which can be distinguished from the tear drop sign.
