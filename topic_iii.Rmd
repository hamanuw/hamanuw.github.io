Figure 2 - IDC on ultrasound in a pregnant patient

a) Grayscale and 
b) color Doppler evaluation of the right breast demonstrates an irregular hypoechoic mass with internal vascularity corresponding to the mammographic and palpable abnormality
c,d) Prominent lymph nodes (arrows) with thickened cortices were identified in the axilla on grayscale and color Doppler images. The mass was biopsied under ultrasound, yielding invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS, poorly differentiated.

Figure 3 - IDC in a pregnant patient on MRI performed for extent of disease evaluation

a) Sagittal T2-weighted FS image demonstrates marked hyperintensity of the glandular tissue related to lactation
b,c) Sagittal T1-weighted FS post-contrast images demonstrate enlarged right axillary lymph nodes (arrow heads) and an irregular round necrotic mass (arrows) corresponding to the known malignancy with washout kinetics on CAD analysis (not shown).

**Teaching Points**: 
Pregnancy associated breast carcinoma (PABC) is a rare occurrence with an estimated frequency of 2.3 cases per 100,000 deliveries and represents up to 3% of all breast malignancies. The diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy is a challenging situation for the patient and the clinician because it involves both the mother and the fetus. The hormone-induced changes that occur in breast tissue during pregnancy and lactation is a major cause of delay in diagnosis of PABC, therefore, resulting in poorer outcome. Given its high sensitivity compared to mammography, ultrasound is considered the initial imaging test in symptomatic pregnant or lactating women. However, mammography should be almost always performed in adjunct to ultrasound to evaluate for the presence of accompanying features of malignancy such as microcalcifications. The radiologic features of PABC are similar to those of non-PABC. MR imaging in pregnant women should not be used routinely, although there is no known adverse effect of MRI on the fetus.  In lactating women, the breast parenchyma shows diffuse increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images due to the fraction of mobile water in milk. Following contrast administration, lactational parenchyma demonstrates an initial rapid enhancement and a subsequent early plateau of enhancement. Tumors can be well visualized on the T2W sequence is these patients.
