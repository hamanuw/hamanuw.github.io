**Teaching points**: 

Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) is a heterogeneous disease varying in clinical presentation, morphology and behavior. The published studies indicate that DCIS of all grades has the potential to progress to invasive ductal carcinoma.  However high-grade DCIS has been shown to progress more rapidly than lower grade lesions and are more likely to lead to metastatic disease with poor survival outcome.  The MRI appearance of natural progression of high grade DCIS is illustrated in this case demonstrating dramatic increase in loco-regional disease with parenchymal spread of tumor, skin involvement and axillary metastasis.  Breast MRI is a sensitive modality for evaluating interval change of malignancy not only in successful neo-adjuvant therapy cases but also in cases of failed treatment.

b) An additional  sagittal post-contrast subtraction image  reveals additional enhancement extending towards the nipple (arrowheads) for which there is no mammographic correlate. Biopsy clip artifact is seen (white arrow).

**Teaching points**:

Although mammography has been the mainstay for diagnosis of DCIS, there has been a tendency in underestimating the extension of disease, especially in patients without microcalcifications or in those with dense breasts or breast implants.  MRI has been more sensitive in detecting pure DCIS compared to mammography.  In many instances, MRI can reveal early stage breast cancer, including DCIS and DCIS with small invasive carcinomas, which are mammographically, sonographically, and clinically occult.  However, no differences in MR morphologic or kinetic features have been reported between low grade and high grade DCIS.  

In our example,  linear distribution of calcifications were identified on mammography which correspond to linear nonmass enhancement on the T1W post contrast imagines, a finding that has been shown to be more likely associated with high-grade DCIS.

##ca low grade DCIS

History: 51-year-old woman undergoing high risk screening breast MRI. 

(a)<img src="images/LF3/ca_low_DCIS/a1a.tif" style="width:40%">

a) Sagittal T1-weighted fat-suppressed post-contrast image of the right breast demonstrates a 1.2 cm area of linear nonmass enhancement (arrows) along the right 10:00 axis
b) Sagittal T1-weighted fat-suppressed post-contrast image of the right axilla shows no lymphadenopathy. The findings were mammographically and sonographically occult. MRI guided biopsy of the nonmass enhancement yielded low grade DCIS.

**Teaching Points**:

MRI has been shown to be more sensitive than mammography in detection of all grades of DCIS, with the highest sensitivity for detection of high-grade and intermediate-grade DCIS as compared with low-grade DCIS.  Mammographically, low-grade DCIS present as amorphous calcifications on mammography and are more likely to present as a mass or asymmetry than high-grade DCIS. On MR imaging, non-mass enhancement is usually associated with all grades of DCIS (60%–81% of cases). Low-grade DCIS typically has benign blood flow enhancement kinetics, however, no individual kinetic pattern has been demonstrated to predict DCIS grade.

##ca idc nipple involvement

b) post-contrast  images of the right breast demonstrate a heterogeneously enhancing irregular T1 isointense retroareolar mass (arrows) involving the nipple
c) CAD enhancement kinetics analysis demonstrates a mixed enhancement pattern
d) Post-contrast 3D MIP image shows the enhancing retroareolar mass (arrows) involving the nipple.

**Teaching Points**: 

The nipple may be involved by extension of underlying invasive ductal carcinoma, by ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or by Paget cells within the epidermis.  The incidence of clinically silent nipple involvement by cancer has been shown to be higher than that previously known, according to histopathologic examination of the nipple in mastectomy specimens.  Therefore, it is important to rule out occult carcinoma within the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) site in patients undergoing nipple-sparing mastectomy.  
MRI-measured tumor size and distance from the NAC are correlated with increased risk of NAC involvement. With the advantages of preoperative MRI, it is possible to make a valid prediction of the extent of disease, and in particular, occult nipple invasion.

c) CC spot magnification, and
d) ML magnification mammographic views of the left breast demonstrate an irregular, spiculated mass (arrows) in the slightly lateral left breast with associated architectural distortion and pleomorphic calcifications.  Biopsy yielded invasive lobular carcinoma.

**Teaching Points**:

MR imaging has been shown to affect clinical management in 50% of patients with ILC, leading to changes in surgical management in 28% of cases.  Tumors less than 2 cm from the nipple or larger than 2 cm are the only factors that have been significantly associ¬ated with NAC involvement.  Preoperative MR imaging can be performed to evaluate disease near the NAC (nipple-areolar complex) and determine the patient’s eligibility for nipple-sparing mastectomy.

c) an axial post-contrast 3D MIP image show a heterogeneously enhancing irregular mass (arrowheads) in the central right breast with axillary lymphadenopathy (arrows). This underwent biopsy and was an invasive ductal carcinoma. A subtle area of mammographic asymmetry can be seen in retrospect.

**Teaching Points**:

Breast MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of clinically occult breast cancer in patients with malignant axillary adenopathy. Breast MRI can detect an otherwise mammographically and sonographically occult breast cancer in over 60% of patients.  Routine application of breast MRI in occult breast cancer can impact clinical management including the possibility of breast conserving surgery. This is one of the generally accepted clinical indications for breast MRI.

b) MLO  spot compression views performed in an area of palpable abnormality demonstrate vague nodular asymmetries (arrows) that partially efface . Ultrasound and MRI findings are more diagnostic.

**Teaching points**:

Multicentric disease (MCD) is defined as two or more tumor areas in different quadrants of the same breast. A number of studies have reported the capability of MRI to identify additional cancer foci that would have otherwise remained undetected on the basis of clinical assessment and conventional imaging, thereby, changing surgical planning. Data suggest that MCD may be more common in patients with certain molecular subtypes (luminal B and HER2), as illustrated in this case.

In patients with advanced breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases eligibility for breast conservation treatment by 46% in patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also effective in reducing burden of disease in the axilla and could potentially decrease the extent of axillary surgery. 

It is important for the radiologist to review the pre-contrast nonfat saturated T1-weighted images for presence of fat within the rim enhancing lesions to help differentiate fat necrosis from additional malignant lesions.

b) Post biopsy ML and 
c) XCCL views of both of these areas (arrows) with clip placement (arrow heads) yielded invasive lobular carcinoma. Patient underwent mastectomy which demonstrated the largest contiguous involvement of cancer to be 5.8 cm. 

**Teaching Points**: 

Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histologic type of breast carcinoma, accounting for approximately 10%–15% of all invasive breast cancers. Its mammographic manifestation may vary and can be a vague finding such as architectural distortion or asymmetry. Higher false-negative rates (up to 19%) are reported for ILC than for other invasive cancers at mammography because ILC is often difficult to diagnose mammographically and therefore, disease extent may be underestimated.
