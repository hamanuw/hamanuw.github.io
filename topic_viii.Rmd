**Teaching Points**:   

Although there is no direct evidence that screening with MRI will reduce mortality, it is thought that early detection by using annual MRI as surveillance for high risk women, in addition to mammography, may be useful. The American Cancer Society recommends screening MRI to be performed for women who are at high risk for breast cancer based on certain factors. This group includes: 

1.	Women with 20% to 25% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer, according to risk assessment tools that are based mainly on family history.  
2.	Women with known BRCA1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation. 
3.	Women with a first degree relative with a BRCA1 or 2 gene mutation and have not had genetic testing themselves. 
4.	Women who had radiation therapy to the chest when they were between the ages or 10-30 years.
5.	Women who have Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden Syndrome, or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome or have first degree relatives with one of these syndromes.
BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are tumor suppressor genes that play a role in DNA repair and mutations in either genes are associated with an autosomal dominant inherited form of breast and/or ovarian cancer. The two cases illustrate high sensitivity of breast MRI to detect clinically favorable early breast cancers in patients with high risk for breast cancer including patients with BRCA1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations. Lack of hyperintense T2 correlate should elevate the level of suspicion and biopsy should be performed in these high risk patients regardless of no corresponding sonographic correlate.

b) Sagittal  post-contrast subtraction image demonstrate no suspicious enhancement within the lumpectomy bed
c) Sagittal post-contrast subtraction image without and 
d) with CAD color overlay demonstrates a 1.2 cm area of suspicious linear nonmass enhancement (arrow) with mixed enhancement kinetics lateral to the lumpectomy site. No sonographic or mammographic correlate was identified. The area underwent MRI-guided biopsy which yielded ADH. 

**Teaching Points**:

Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia (ADH) is the most common high-risk lesion and is defined as ductal proliferation that is considered to increase a women’s life time risk of developing ductal carcinoma. In 20-50% of the time, depending on the needle gauge, ADH is upgraded histologically to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive cancer at the time of surgical excision. 
According to a recent review in 2012, no studies showed specific predictive morphologic or kinetic MRI characteristics for high-risk lesions. Moreover, there were no imaging features that could reliably predict subsequent upgrade to malignancy. The MRI appearance of ADH is variable, ranging from a mass to linear non-mass enhancement mimicking DCIS.  
In our case example, atypical ductal hyperplasia was diagnosed on breast MRI in a patient with personal history of cancer. The American cancer society recommendations, however, remain controversial regarding performing yearly MRI screening for patients with personal history of breast cancer, DCIS or high risk lesions such as ADH, atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and lobular carcinoma in situ(LCIS).

#high risk LCIS

d) CAD analysis (blue color). 

**Teaching Points**: 

Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is noninvasive proliferations of lobular cells known to be an indicator of future increased risk for breast cancer development. Existing data suggest that pleomorphic histology or large volumes of LCIS may be predictive of a more focally aggressive carcinoma. LCIS is usually an incidental finding at core biopsy as it has no reliable imaging features. The most common imaging features that have been associated with LCIS are grouped amorphous calcifications on mammography and focus or non–mass-like enhancement with persistent enhancement kinetics on MRI. No Specific features have been identified sonographically.  The currently available management recommendations of LCIS diagnosed at core biopsy is surgical excision of the biopsy site, particularly those of pleomorphic type.

Figure 2 - Targeted ultrasound image of the left breast demonstrates a corresponding ill-defined hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic shadowing (arrowheads). Biopsy yielded a radial scar.

*Teaching Points*:

Radial scar is a benign breast lesion characterized by a central fibro-elastotic core with entrapped ducts surrounded by cystic ducts and lobules showing a spectrum of proliferative changes. They typically measure less than 1 cm and usually called complex sclerosing lesions if they are 1 cm or greater.  Radial scars are typically seen in women younger than 50 years of age. The most common MR imaging feature is non-mass enhancement, including in linear or clumped distribution, with associated distortion and type 2 or 3 enhancement kinetics.
Radial sclerosing lesions are associated with an elevated risk for subsequent development of breast cancer and many studies have reported association with malignancy in up to 40% of cases. The current management recommendations are surgical excision. However, some published reviews suggest that excision of radial scars should only be performed if associated with atypia.

**Teaching points**:

Cowden syndrome is an uncommon, autosomal dominant disease in patients with PTEN geneline mutation. It is characterized by multiple hamartomas of the skin, mucous membrane, brain, breast, thyroid, and gastrointestinal tract and increased susceptibility of breast cancer. The lifetime risk for breast carcinoma in Cowden syndrome is estimated to be 25–50%, compared to 12% in the general women population. 

Patients with Cowden syndrome can have bilateral multiple fibroadenomas in the breast as illustrated in this case, which makes it challenging to detect breast cancers.  Fibroadenomas usually enhance homogeneously and have associated T2 hyper intensity and can demonstrate non-enhancing septations. The degree of enhancement and T2 signal intensity can vary.  The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends breast self-examination beginning at the age of 18 years and annual screening with breast MRI and mammography starting between 30 and 35 years of age and not earlier than 25 years.  After establishing a baseline, any change will indicate work up to exclude malignancy.

Figure 1 - MRI showing cancer recurrence at the lumpectomy bed in a patient with history of XXX breast conservation

a) Sagittal T1-weighted FS pre-contrast and 
b) T2-weighted FS images of the XXX breast demonstrate post radiation skin thickening (arrowheads) and the lumpectomy site, (arrows) which is heterogeneously T2 hyperintense
c) Sagittal T1-weighted FS post-contrast image with CAD color overlay demonstrates irregular thick rim enhancement with washout kinetics (red, arrows) and adjacent background parenchymal enhancement with persistent kinetics (blue). 

**Teaching Points**:

It has been estimated that tumor recurrence rates is about 1-2% per year in women who underwent breast conservation.  It is usually discovered later than 18-24 months after treatment.  Detection of treatment failure in these women while it is still asymptomatic improves relative survival by 27-47%.  

Lumpectomy site is a common site of recurrence as illustrated in this case.   Patients with recurrence following lumpectomy of the original cancer and radiation are usually treated with salvage mastectomy. Breast MRI has a high sensitivity in the detection of breast cancer as high as 94–100%. MRI screening of women with only a personal history of breast cancer was clinically valuable finding malignancies in 12% of the patients in a published study.  However, personal history is generally not an accepted indication for screening breast MRI.
