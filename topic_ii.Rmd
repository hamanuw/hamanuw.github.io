Figure 2 - Hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cyst

a) Sagittal T2-weighted FS and corresponding 
b) Sagittal T1-weighted FS pre-contrast images demonstrate a lobular T1 and T2 hyperintense mass in the upper central breast (arrows), compatible with a hemorrhagic cyst. Note the smaller more posterior nonhemorrhagic cyst (arrow-head) for comparison.

**Teaching Points**:

Simple cysts result from dilatation and effacement of the terminal duct lobular unit. They are commonly seen incidentally on MRI and follow fluid signal on all sequences (appear very hyperintense on T2-weighted images and intermediate to low on T1-weighted images). On postcontrast images, cysts do not typically enhance, however, the periphery of the cyst may enhance if there is surrounding cystic inflammation.  Not infrequently, may have intermediate or high signal on T1-weighted images due to contents of proteinaceous contents or blood products.

Figure 1 - Benign dilated ducts

a) Sagittal T1-weighted FS post-contrast image of the left breast demonstrates linear hyperintensity (arrows) in the central middle third of the breast which could represent non-mass enhancement. However, 
b) the pre-contrast  sequence demonstrates similar linear hyperintensity, and 
c) the sagittal post-contrast subtraction image demonstrates no enhancement in this location. Findings are consistent with proteinaceous or hemorrhagic material in the ducts. 
d) T2-weighted FS image shows xxx. 

**Teaching Points**: 

Normal ducts are usually invisible on breast MRI. However, in the setting of a chronic obstructive process, they become dilated and present as high signal intensity branching tubular structures on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images (due to proteinaceous or hemorrhagic material). Dilated ducts do not typically enhance, however, enhancement of the ductal wall maybe seen due to underlying inflammation. It is important to remember that assessment of enhancement should not depend merely on the subtracted images as misregistration artifact may occur.

Figure 2 - Fibroadenoma on ultrasound

- Second look ultrasound  was performed demonstrating an oval circumscribed hypoechoic mass corresponding to the MRI mass.


**Teaching Points**: 

Fibroadenomas are frequently seen on breast MRI and are best evaluated by their morphologic appearance. A classic benign feature is a smooth margin with hypointense internal septa on T2-weighted images.  Less than 40% of Fibroadenomas demonstrate nonenhancing internal septations which, if present can be predictive of their benignity (>95%). MRI enhancement kinetics alone is neither specific nor sensitive due to the overlap in enhancement characteristics between benign and malignant lesions. Therefore, kinetics can only be helpful if benign features are present.

Figure 1 - Fibrocystic change

a) Sagittal T2-weighted FS
b) Post-contrast subtraction images demonstrate a mildly T2 hyperintense round mass (arrows) with progressive enhancement on 
c) CAD analysis. No sonographic correlate was identified, and subsequent MRI-guided core biopsy yielded fibrocystic change. 

**Teaching Points**: 

Fibrocystic change (FCC) is a common benign condition, most often bilateral, that affects more than 50% of women.  Fibrocystic parenchyma, like normal parenchyma, has a variable appearance dependent on the water and collagen content of the tissues.  It might present as a discrete mass or density mimicking tumor in which case, both mammography and sonography are considered unreliable.  On breast MRI, Fibrocystic change is usually difficult to distinguish from normal breast tissue on both T2W and T2W noncontrast images. However, on dynamic contrast enhanced images, it usually demonstrates scattered foci of regional enhancement with progressive kinetic analysis (Fig.1 a-c).

## b9 gallstone

Figure 1 - Incidental gallstone

a) Axial 
b) sagittal localizing images demonstrate a hypointense round structure (arrow-heads) in the gallbladder, characteristic of a gallstone.  

**Teaching Points**:

When performing MRI of the breast, systematic evaluation of other anatomic structures and organs contained within the field-of-view is important.  Incidental findings are not uncommon on breast MRI; about one in five patients will have an extramammary finding. 
Gallstones are found in about 10% of the general population and twice as common in women as in men.  They are more prevalent with increasing age and often detected incidentally.  According to a recent study by Niell et al, gallstones were found to represent approximately 2% of all benign extramammary findings that required no additional work up. They are best appreciated at T2-weighted MR images and localizing sequences.

Figure 1 - Intramammary lymph node

a) Sagittal T1-weighted FS post-contrast image of the right breast demonstrates a 4 mm focus of enhancement (arrow) in the lower outer anterior breast with 
b) Suspicious washout enhancement pattern color coded as red on CAD
c) On the subtraction image, the morphology of the enhancement appears reniform (arrow) with an adjacent feeding vessel (arrow-head). d) Sagittal T2-weighted FS image demonstrates peripheral hyperintensity and 
e) sagittal T1-weighted image demonstrates central hyperintensity (arrow-head), compatible with a fatty hilum. 

**Teaching Points**: 

Normal intramammary lymph nodes are usually seen as oval or reniform, smoothly marginated fat containing masses. They are often seen adjacent to vessels within the upper outer quadrant, although 28% of intramammary lymph nodes are found in other locations. They are usually nonpalpable and found incidentally on breast MRI where they appear hyperintense on T2-weighted images. They typically demonstrate homogenous enhancement with rapid initial and washout delayed kinetics. Non-fat saturated T1-weighted images are usually helpful to confirm the presence of fat within the hilum. 

Biopsy can be avoided if the mass demonstrates classic characteristics of a benign lymph node in patients who have no increased risk for malignancy.

b) Sagittal T2-weighted images demonstrate a lobulated hyperintense structure (arrows) adjacent to the heart
c) Axial and 
d) Sagittal T1-weighted FS post-contrast images demonstrate no enhancement of this structure, consistent with a cyst.

**Teaching points**:
When performing MRI of the breast, systematic evaluation of other anatomic structures and organs contained within the field-of-view is important.  Incidental findings are not uncommon on breast MRI; about one in five patients will have an extramammary finding.
Pericardial cysts are rare mediastinal cysts occurring with an incidence of 1 in 100,000. The majority of them is asymptomatic and arises in the anterior cardiophrenic angle, more frequently on the right side. Mediastinal cystic lesions constitute about 3% of all benign extramammary findings found on Breast MRI, as observed by Dr. Niell, where no additional assessment is indicated. 

As shown in Fig. 11 (A-D), pericardial cyst, like any other mediastinal cyst, appears thin walled with classic cystic features of low signal intensity on T1-weighted and a homogenous hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images.

b) and T1-weighted FS pre- and  
c) post-contrast images demonstrate a round homogeneously enhancing T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense mass (arrows)
d) CAD demonstrates mixed enhancement kinetics with a predominant washout pattern.

**Teaching Points**:

Phyllodes tumors are rare and constitute 0.3-1.0% of all breast tumors. They have a high incidence of local recurrence after surgery and potential for hematogenous metastases.  Due to their rapid growth, Phyllodes tumors tend to have well-circumscribed margins on mammography and sonography which makes it difficult to distinguish from Fibroadenomas on the basis of imaging. Large Phyllodes tumors have a characteristic morphologic appearance on breast MRI including smooth margins, internal cysts and septations. They typically demonstrate low T1-weighted signal intensity and appear somewhat bright on the T2-weighted images. Literature has shown that contrast enhancement pattern can be variable and therefore, differentiation of Phyllodes and Fibroadenomas on breast MRI remains unreliable.

Figure 1 - Saline implant rupture

a) Sagittal T1-weighted post-contrast MIP demonstrates no suspicious enhancement
b) Sagittal T2-weighted FS image demonstrates a collapsed saline implant (arrows) with surrounding T2 hyperintensity (arrowheads). 
c) Sagittal and 
d) Axial T1-weighted FS images demonstrate corresponding T1 hypointensity surrounding the collapsed implant (arrows).

**Teaching Points**: 

Implant rupture is a well-known complication after surgery and is the main cause of implant removal. Most ruptures have no obvious traumatic origin and sometimes occur in asymptomatic patients.  MRI is generally accepted as the technique of choice for evaluating implant integrity of silicone implant, with a sensitivity of 70-94% and a specificity of 85-100%.  Patients with saline implant rupture usually report an obvious change in size with extrusion of the fluid for which breast MRI is not recommended.  Saline implants follow fluid signal on all sequences and have a valve to allow volume adjustment, which helps identify them on MRI. In our case example (A-D), saline rupture was incidentally found on a screening MRI for a high risk woman demonstrating complete collapse of the implant.
