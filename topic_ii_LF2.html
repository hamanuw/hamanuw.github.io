<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>Breast MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for the detection of clinically occult breast cancer in patients with malignant axillary adenopathy. Breast MRI can detect an otherwise mammographically and sonographically occult breast cancer in over 60% of patients. Routine application of breast MRI in occult breast cancer can impact clinical management including the possibility of breast conserving surgery. This is one of the generally accepted clinical indication for breast MRI.</p>

A representative area in the left breast and an axillary lymph node underwent ultrasound guided biopsy yielding invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified with axillary metastasis.</p>
<p>Figure 3. (a) Axial T1-weighted fat suppressed post-contrast image shows a large irregular mass (arrows) in the outer mid to posterior left breast spanning 4.2 cm in transverse dimension. Localizing clip artifact (arrow head) is noted in the outer aspect of the mass. (b,c) The mass (arrows) spans 7.2 cm in AP dimension and 9.8 cm in CC dimension on the sagittal T1-weighted fat suppressed post-contrast images. Localizing clip artifact (arrowhead) is noted in the upper aspect of the mass. No adjacent pectoralis muscle enhancement is present to suggest involvement. (d) Two enlarged axillary lymph nodes are present on a sagittal T1-weighted fat suppressed post-contrast image, one of which (inferior) likely corresponds to the known metastatic disease. No suspicious finding was present in the contralateral breast (not shown). The patient underwent left mastectomy, with final pathology showing 9.3 cm of disease and 3 positive axillary lymph nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>There is literature support for pre-operative MRI in patients with extremely dense and heterogeneously dense breasts. As illustrated in this case, the extensive malignancy is better delineated on the MRI compare to the mammogram in the setting of dense breasts. In addition, the sonographic findings were also vague without clear delineation of the extent of disease. The mastectomy specimen confirms the extent of disease best delineated by the breast MRI. It is important to note that breast MRI can also overestimate disease due to non-tumoral enhancement of the surrounding tissue related to inflammation and edema.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>Breast MRI is commonly performed for extent of disease evaluation and pre-operative planning. However, it is currently not generally accepted by the surgical community due to unclear long term benefit in terms of patient survival outcome, especially in the setting of adjuvant chemo and radiation therapy. Breast MRI may be more important in patients who are relying only surgery for their treatment. In addition, there is literature support for performing pre-operative MRI in patients with invasive lobular cancer for better estimation of disease and additional finding especially in patients with dense breasts. This patient underwent wide excision yielding 8.2 cm of disease with negative margin on final pathology. Compared to the mammogram, the breast MRI gave more accurate estimation of disease in this case. It is important to note however that Breast MRI can over-estimate disease due to enhancement of tissue surrounding the tumor related to edema, inflammation and desmoplastic reaction. The invasive lobular carcinoma in this case demonstrated persistent benign appearing delayed enhancement pattern. This case illustrates the importance of utilizing morphology as the most important feature to be analyzed as kinetic enhancement pattern can be non-specific.</p>

<p>Invasive lobular carcinoma with multicentric disease identified on MRI.</p>
<p>Figure 1. There is a focal asymmetry in the far posterior inferior and slightly medial right breast on (b) MLO and (d) CC mammographic views (arrows). The focal asymmetry persisted on the spot compression views (not shown) and ultrasound was performed for further evaluation. (See Figure 2.) An asymmetry (arrowhead) was also noted in the upper right breast without a definite correlate on the CC view, and no sonographic correlate was reported. (a) An asymmetry (arrow) is noted in the posterior lower left breast without a definite correlate on the CC view. The appearance was similar to prior mammograms, and the finding was considered benign.</p>
<p>Figure 2. Targeted right breast ultrasound demonstrates a 2.5 cm irregular hypoechoic mass along the 5:00 axis corresponding to the mammographic focal asymmetry. This mass underwent biopsy yielding invasive lobular carcinoma.</p>
<p>Figure 3. Sagittal T1-weighted post-contrast subtraction images of the right breast demonstrate (a) a 3.1 cm irregular mass (arrows) in the posterior 5:00 axis of the right breast with central localizing clip artifact (arrowhead), which yielded malignancy on biopsy.Additional suspicious enhancement is noted in (b) the retroareolar right breast (arrows) and (c,d) along the 10:00 -10:30 axis (arrows)..</p>
<p>Figure 4. Second look ultrasound was performed for the additional MRI findings. (a) Targeted ultrasound of the upper outer right breast shows 2 adjacent mildly hypoechoic masses likely corresponding to the areas of 10:00-10:30 MRI enhancement (and, in retrospect, to the mammographic asymmetry). (b) Targeted ultrasound of the retroareolar right breast demonstrates a hypoechoic mass likely corresponding to the subareolar MRI enhancement. The 10:00 mass underwent ultrasound guided biopsy yielding invasive lobular carcinoma. This proved multicentric disease, and the patient underwent mastectomy rather than lumpectomy.</p>

<p>Pre-operative breast MRI can detect additional cancers in ipsilateral breast in 20-30% of the cases and contralateral breast in 5% of the cases impacting clinical management, especially in patient with invasive lobular cancer and dense breasts as illustrated in this case. It is important to note that pathology confirmation is needed to document multicentric disease despite suspicious appearance of additional findings on MRI. Sonographic features of certain malignancies can be subtle and breast MRI can help better localize the finding as shown in this case.</p>

<p>Medullary carcinoma of the breast is a rare type of invasive ductal breast cancer and accounts for ~3% of all breast cancers and can occur in younger women including 10% of cases in women under 35 years. On histology, medullary carcinomas have been classified as either typical or atypical. Atypical medullary carcinomas are now classified as invasive ductal carcinomas with medullary features. Patients with medullary carcinoma have a more favorable prognosis than those with atypical medullary carcinoma and non-medullary carcinoma. The morphologic features of medullary carcinomas and fibroadenomas can overlap. Mammographically, medullary carcinoma is a round, ovoid or lobular mass with ill-defined or circumscribed margins. On ultrasound, the mass can be either homogeneously hypo-echoic or hypo-echoic with mild heterogeneity. Posterior acoustic enhancement may be present, On MRI, medullary carcinomas appeared as masses with an oval or lobular shape and circumscribed margins. The tumors were iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images and iso- or hyperintense on T2-weighted images relative to the surrounding breast tissue. Kinetics curve showed a rapid initial increase in enhancement and a washout or plateau delayed enhancement pattern. Many of the imaging features typical for medullary carcinoma were present in our case. The patient underwent breast conservation with final pathology; typical medullary carcinoma, stage T2,N0.</p>

<p>Mucinous carcinoma of the breast is a rare form (2% of all breast cancers) of invasive ductal carcinoma and is sometimes called colloid carcinoma. The tumor is made up of abnormal cells within pools of mucin, a key component in the slimy, slippery mucus. It can histologically divided into pure mucinous breast cancer or mixed mucinous breast cancer. Mucinous carcinoma is extremely rare in men and in women, more common after menopause in 60s or early 70s. Mammographically, the presence of mucin results in a low-density and relatively well-defined lobular mass. Sonographically, mixed cystic and solid components, posterior acoustic enhancement, and micro-lobulated margins are commonly seen. On MRI, they can have very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images as illustrated in this case, which relates to the water component in mucin. Post contrast enhancement can be variable. Typically, a pure mucinous sub type carries a better prognosis compared to invasive ductal carcinoma NOS. Mixed mucinous carcinoma of the breast tend to have a more aggressive behavior than pure sub-type as illustrated in this case with distant metastasis.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>In patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, breast MRI provides the best correlation with final surgical pathology compared to physical examination, mammography, and sonography and is one of the generally accepted indication for getting a breast MRI evaluation. However, MRI may overestimate (6%) or underestimate (23%) residual disease in approximately 29% of the patients.</p>
<p>RECIST guideline for tumor response: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the Longest Diameter (LD) of target lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions.</p>
<p>The patient in our case demonstrates partial response to neoadjuvant therapy and on final surgical pathology showed 1.9 cm residual tumor and 2 positive axillary lymph nodes. , Neoadjuvant treatment can be effective in reducing locally advanced tumor and in certain cases breast conservation can become a surgical treatment option rather than mastectomy.<br />
In patients with a good response, in addition to the reduction in size of tumor, change in enhancement pattern to persistent from washout pattern as well overall decrease in the amount of background parenchymal enhancement have been noted, as illustrated in this case.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching points</strong>:</p>
<p>Papillary carcinoma of the breast is a rare type of invasive ductal breast cancer and accounts for ~2% of all breast cancers and usually occurs in post menopausal women with average age of 65 years. Clinically can manifest as a palpable mass or nipple discharge occurring most commonly in the retro-areolar/sub-areolar location. Classified as papillary ductal carcinoma in situ, intracystic papillary carcinoma (ICPC) with or without invasion or solid papillary carcinoma (if no cystic component is present). Invasive elements are typically detected at the periphery of the lesion. Histologically, it is characterized by a frond-like growth pattern on a fibrovascular core lacking a myoepithelial layer. Mammographically, papillary carcinoma can present as a round, oval or lobulated mass with usually circumscribed margin. Sonographically, papillary carcinoma presents as a complex cystic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement or as hypoechoic solid mass. Increased vascularity is often present on color flow Doppler interrogation. On MRI, intracystic papillary carcinoma appears as complex cystic or multi-cystic masses with heterogeneous internal composition with enhancing nodular masses and variable fluid content. Hemorrhagic contents can be hyper-intense on both T1- and T2-weighted images and fluid-fluid levels may be seen as illustrated in our case. Serous contents can show T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity. Post contrast images can show variable enhancement involving the cyst walls, septa, and mural nodules. Patients with papillary carcinoma have a more favorable prognosis than those with invasive ductal carcinoma NOS.</p>
